# Webhook-Based Payment Verification System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive webhook-based payment verification system implemented for PraxisAI's QR payment functionality. The system provides multiple verification methods to ensure reliable payment confirmation and automatic Pro access activation.

## Architecture

### 1. Payment Flow
```
User Scans QR â†’ Makes Payment â†’ Payment Provider â†’ Webhook â†’ Backend â†’ User Upgraded
```

### 2. Verification Methods

#### A. Webhook Verification (Primary)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/payment/webhook/{provider}`
- **Providers Supported**: 
  - `razorpay` - Razorpay payment gateway
  - `payu` - PayU payment gateway  
  - `upi` - Direct UPI integration
- **Process**: Payment providers send real-time notifications when payments are completed

#### B. Automatic Verification (Secondary)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/payment/qr/verify-automatic`
- **Process**: Backend actively polls payment provider APIs to check payment status
- **Fallback**: Used when webhooks are not available or delayed

#### C. Manual Verification (Tertiary)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/payment/qr/verify-manual`
- **Process**: User manually confirms payment after completing transaction
- **Fallback**: Used when automatic systems fail

#### D. Hybrid Verification (Recommended)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/payment/qr/verify-hybrid` (Frontend API)
- **Process**: Tries automatic verification first, falls back to manual if needed
- **Benefits**: Best user experience with maximum reliability

## Database Schema

### New Fields Added to `payment_qr_codes` Table

```sql
ALTER TABLE payment_qr_codes 
ADD COLUMN payment_provider VARCHAR(50),           -- 'razorpay', 'payu', 'upi', 'manual'
ADD COLUMN transaction_id VARCHAR(255),            -- Provider's transaction ID
ADD COLUMN webhook_received_at TIMESTAMP,          -- When webhook was received
ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

### Indexes for Performance

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_qr_codes_transaction_id ON payment_qr_codes(transaction_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_qr_codes_status ON payment_qr_codes(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_qr_codes_user_status ON payment_qr_codes(user_id, status);
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Webhook Handlers

#### Razorpay Webhook
```python
@router.post("/payment/webhook/razorpay")
async def payment_webhook(provider: str, request: Request):
    # Extracts payment details from Razorpay webhook payload
    # Updates payment status and upgrades user subscription
```

#### PayU Webhook
```python
@router.post("/payment/webhook/payu") 
async def payment_webhook(provider: str, request: Request):
    # Extracts payment details from PayU webhook payload
    # Updates payment status and upgrades user subscription
```

#### UPI Webhook
```python
@router.post("/payment/webhook/upi")
async def payment_webhook(provider: str, request: Request):
    # Extracts payment details from UPI webhook payload
    # Updates payment status and upgrades user subscription
```

### 2. Payment Provider Integration

#### Current Status
- **Webhook endpoints**: âœ… Implemented and ready
- **Payment provider APIs**: ðŸ”„ Mock implementation (ready for integration)
- **Database schema**: âœ… Updated with new fields
- **Frontend integration**: âœ… Hybrid verification implemented

#### Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Razorpay Integration**
   ```bash
   # Register webhook URL with Razorpay
   Webhook URL: https://praxis-ai.fly.dev/api/payment/webhook/razorpay
   Events: payment.captured, payment.failed
   ```

2. **PayU Integration**
   ```bash
   # Register webhook URL with PayU
   Webhook URL: https://praxis-ai.fly.dev/api/payment/webhook/payu
   Events: payment.success, payment.failure
   ```

3. **UPI Direct Integration**
   ```bash
   # Contact bank for UPI merchant API access
   # Implement NPCI UPI API integration
   ```

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### API Methods Added

```typescript
// Manual verification
paymentAPI.verifyManualPayment(qr_code, user_id)

// Automatic verification  
paymentAPI.verifyAutomaticPayment(qr_code, user_id)

// Hybrid verification (recommended)
paymentAPI.verifyPaymentHybrid(qr_code, user_id)
```

#### QR Payment Modal Updates

- **Hybrid Verification**: Tries automatic first, falls back to manual
- **Better UX**: Shows verification method used (automatic/manual)
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and retry logic

## Security Considerations

### 1. Webhook Security
- **Signature Verification**: Implement signature verification for webhooks
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict webhook endpoints to known provider IPs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints

### 2. Payment Verification
- **Amount Validation**: Verify payment amounts match expected values
- **Transaction ID Validation**: Ensure transaction IDs are unique and valid
- **User Authorization**: Verify payment belongs to requesting user

### 3. Database Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement proper database connection management
- **Audit Logging**: Log all payment verification attempts

## Testing

### 1. Webhook Testing
```bash
# Test Razorpay webhook
curl -X POST https://praxis-ai.fly.dev/api/payment/webhook/razorpay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"payload":{"payment":{"entity":{"id":"pay_123","amount":9900,"status":"captured"}}}}'

# Test PayU webhook  
curl -X POST https://praxis-ai.fly.dev/api/payment/webhook/payu \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"transactionId":"TXN123","amount":99,"status":"success"}'
```

### 2. Manual Verification Testing
```bash
# Test manual verification
curl -X POST "https://praxis-ai.fly.dev/api/payment/qr/verify-manual?qr_code=QR123&user_id=user123"
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Payment Status Tracking
- **Real-time Status**: Track payment status changes
- **Webhook Logs**: Log all webhook requests and responses
- **Verification Logs**: Log all verification attempts

### 2. Error Monitoring
- **Failed Payments**: Alert on payment failures
- **Webhook Failures**: Alert on webhook processing errors
- **Database Errors**: Monitor database connection issues

## Deployment

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run migration script
psql -h $SUPABASE_HOST -U $SUPABASE_USER -d $SUPABASE_DB -f add_webhook_fields.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Add payment provider credentials
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY=your_payu_merchant_key
PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT=your_payu_merchant_salt
```

### 3. Webhook Configuration
- Register webhook URLs with payment providers
- Configure webhook events and authentication
- Test webhook endpoints
