CHAPTER  FIVE
WORK, ENERGY AND POWER
5.1  INTRODUCTION
The terms ‘work’, ‘energy’ and ‘power’ are frequently used
in everyday language.  A farmer ploughing the field, a
construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for
a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful
landscape , all ar e said to be working. In physics, however ,
the word ‘W ork’ cover s a definite  and precise meaning.
Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a
day is said to have a large stamina or ener gy. W e admir e a
long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is
thus our capacity to do work . In Physics too, the term ‘energy’
is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term
‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The wor d ‘power’
is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In
karate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are
delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to
the meaning of the wor d ‘power’ used in physics.  We shall
find that there is at best a loose correlation betwee n the
physical definitions and the physiological pictures these
terms generate in our minds.  The aim of this chapter is to
develop an understanding of these three physi cal quantities.
Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a
mathematical prerequisit e, namely the scalar product of two
vectors.
5.1.1 The Scalar Product
We have lear nt about vectors and their use in Chapter 3.
Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force etc. ar e vectors. W e have also lear nt how vectors ar e
added or subtracted. W e now need to know how vectors ar e
multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which
we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product
gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the
vector pr oduct pr oduces a new vector fr om two vectors. W e
shall look at the vector product in Chapter 6. Here we take
up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or
dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A.B (read5.1 Introduction

A dot B) is defined as
A.B = A B cos θ (5.1a)
where θ  is the angle between the two vectors as
shown in Fig. 5.1(a). Since A, B and cos θ are
scalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar
quantity. Each vector , A and B, has a dir ection
but their scalar product does not have a
direction.
From Eq. (5.1a), we have
A.B  = A (B cos θ )
       = B (A cos θ )
Geometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto
A in Fig.5.1 (b) and A cos θ  is the projection of A
onto B in Fig. 5.1 (c). So, A.B is the product of
the magnitude of A and the component of B along
A. Alternatively, it is the product of the
magnitude of B and the component of A along B.
Equation (5.1a) shows that the scalar product
follows the commutative law :
A.B = B.A
Scalar product obeys the distributive
law:
A. (B + C ) = A.B + A.C
Further ,A. (λ B) = λ (A.B)
wher e λ is a r eal number .
The proofs  of the above equations are left to
you as an exercise.
For unit vectors ɵɵɵi, j,k  we have
ɵɵɵɵɵɵi i j j k k⋅ = ⋅ = ⋅ = 1

5.3  WORK
As seen earlier , work is r elated to for ce and the
displacement over which it acts.  Consider a
constant for ce F acting on an object of mass m.
The object undergoes a displacement d in the
positive x-direction as shown in Fig. 5.2.
Fig. 5.2 An object undergoes a displacement d

ENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM
The following relation for rectilinear motion under
constant acceleration a has been encountered
in Chapter 3,
      v2 − u2 = 2 as (5.2)
where u and v  are the initial and final speeds
and 
s the distance traversed.  Multiplying both
sides by m/2, we have
2 2 1 1
2 2mv mu mas Fs− = = (5.2a)
where the last step follows from Newton’s Second
Law. W e can generalise Eq. (5.2) to thr ee
dimensions by employing vectors
v2 − u2 = 2 a.d
Here a and d are acceleration and displacement
vectors of the object respectively.
Once again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain
2 2 1 1
2 2mv mu m − = = a.d F.d (5.2b)
The above equation provides a motivation for
the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The
left side of the equation is the difference in the
quantity ‘half the mass times the square of the
speed’ fr om its initial value to its final value. W e
call each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,
denoted by K. The right side is a product of the
displacement and the component of the force
along the displacement.  This quantity is called
‘work’ and is denoted by W.  Eq. (5.2b) is then
Kf −  Ki = W (5.3)
where Ki  and Kf  are respectively the initial and
final kinetic energies of the object. W ork r efers
to the force and the displacement over which it
acts. Work is done by a for ce on the body over
a certain displacement .
Equation (5.2) is also a special case of the
work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in
kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the
work done on it by the net for ce. We shall
generalise the above derivation to a varying force
in a later section.

raindrop falls under the influence of the
downward gravitational force and the
opposing resistive force.  The latter is known

Example 5.3   A cyclist comes to a skidding
stop in 10 m.  During this process, the force
on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and
is directly opposed to the motion.  (a) How
much work does the road do on the cycle ?
(b) How much work does the cycle do on
the road ?
Answer  Work done on the cycle by the r oad is
the work done by the stopping (frictional) force
on the cycle due to the road.
(a) The stopping force and the displacement make
an angle of 180o  (π rad) with each other .
Thus, work done by the road,
Wr =  Fd cosθ
     =  200 ×  10 × cos π
      = – 2000 J
It is this negative work that brings the cycle
to a halt in accordance with WE theorem.
(b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and
opposite force acts on the road due to the
cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However , the
road undergoes no displacement.  Thus,
work done by cycle on the road is zero.            ⊳
The lesson of Example 5.3 is that though the
force on a body A exerted by the body B is always
equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s
Third Law); the work done on A by B is not
necessarily equal and opposite to the work done
on B by A.
5.4  KINETIC ENERGY
As noted earlier , if an object of mass m has
velocity v, its kinetic energy K  is
2K m mv1 1= =2 2v v.                        (5.5)
Kinetic  energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic
energy of an object is a measure of the work anThe work done by the force is defined to be
the product of component of the force in the
direction of the displacement and the
magnitude of this displacement .  Thus
W = (F cos θ )d = F.d (5.4)
We see that if ther e is no displacement, ther e
is no work done even if the force is large.  Thus,
when you push hard against a rigid brick wall,
the for ce you exert on the wall does no work.  Y et
your muscles are alternatively contracting and
relaxing and internal energy is being used up
and you do get tired.  Thus, the meaning of work
in physics is different from its usage in everyday
language.
No work is done if :
(i)the displacement is zero as seen in the
example above. A weightlifter holding a 150
kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s
does no work on the load during this time.
(ii)the force is zero.  A block moving on a smooth
horizontal table is not acted upon by a
horizontal force (since there is no friction), but
may undergo a large displacement .
(iii)the force and displacement are mutually
perpendicular . This is so since, for θ = π/2 rad
(= 90o), cos (π/2) = 0.  For the block moving on
a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational
force mg  does no work since it acts at right
angles to the displacement. If we assume that
the moon’s orbits around the earth is
perfectly circular then the earth’s
gravitational force does no work.  The moon’s
instantaneous displacement is tangential
while the earth’s force is radially inwards and
θ  = π/2.
Work can be both positive and negative.  If θ  is
between 0o and 90o, cos θ  in Eq. (5.4) is positive.
If  θ  is  between 90o and 180o,   cos θ  is negative.
In many examples the frictional force opposes
displacement and θ  = 180o. Then the work done
by friction is negative (cos 180o = –1).
From Eq. (5.4) it is clear that  work and energy
have the same dimensions,  [ML2T–2]. The SI unit
of these is joule (J), named after the famous British
physicist James Prescott Joule  (1811-1869). Since
work and energy are so widely used as physical
concepts, alternative units abound and some of
these are listed in Table 5.1.

5.5  WORK DONE BY A V ARIABLE FORCE
A constant force is rare.  It is the variable force,
which is more commonly encountered.  Fig. 5.3
is a plot of a varying force in one dimension.
If the displacement 
∆x is small, we can take
the force F(x)  as approximately constant and
the work done is then
∆W =F(x) ∆xTable 5.2  Typical kinetic energies ( K)
This is illustrated in Fig. 5.3(a).  Adding
successive rectangular areas in Fig. 5.3(a) we
get the total work done as

where the summation is from the initial position
xi  to the final position xf.
If the displacements are allowed to approach
zero, then the number of terms in the sum
increases without limit, but the sum approaches
a definite value equal to the area under the curve

From Eq. (5.7), it follows that
           Kf −  Ki  = W (5.8b)
Thus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable
force.
While the WE theorem is useful in a variety of
problems, it does not, in general, incorporate the
complete dynamical information of Newton’s
second law. It is an integral form of Newton’s
second law. Newton’s second law is a relation
between acceleration and force at any instant of
time. W ork-ener gy theor em involves an integral
over an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal
(time) information contained in the statement of
Newton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is

WORK, ENERGY AND POWER 77⊳not available explicitly. Another observation is that
Newton’s second law for two or three dimensions
is in vector form whereas the work-energy
theorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form,
information with respect to directions contained
in Newton’s second law is not present.

5.7  THE CONCEPT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY
The word potential suggests possibility or
capacity for action. The term potential energy
brings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched
bow-string possesses potential energy. When it
is released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.
The earth’s crust is not uniform, but has
discontinuities and dislocations that are called
fault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crustare like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a
large amount of potential energy. An earthquake
results when these fault lines readjust. Thus,
potential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue
of the position or configuration of a body. The
body left to itself releases this stored energy in
the form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion
of potential energy more concrete.
The gravitational force on a ball of mass m is
mg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth
surface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h  of
the ball above the earth’s surface is very small
compared to the earth’s radius RE (h <<RE) so that
we can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s
surface *. In what follows we have taken the
upward direction to be positive. Let us raise the
ball up to a height h. The work done by the external
agency against the gravitational force is mgh. This
work gets stored as potential energy.
Gravitational potential energy of an object, as a
function of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it
is the negative of work done by the gravitational
force in raising the object to that hei ght.
V (h) = mgh
If h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that
the gravitational for ce F equals the negative of
the derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,
d
dF V(h) m gh= − = −
The negative sign indicates that the
gravitational force is downward. When released,
the ball comes down with an increasing speed.
Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given
by the kinematic relation,
v2 = 2gh
This equation can be written as
21
m v2 = m g h
which shows that the gravitational potential
energy of the object at height h, when the object
is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of
the object on reaching the ground.
Physically, the notion of potential energy is
applicable only to the class of forces where work
done against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.
When external constraints are removed, it
manifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,
(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential

The work done by a conservative force such as
gravity depends on the initial and final positions
only. In the previous chapter we have worked
on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an
object of mass m is released from rest, from the
top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of
height h, its speed at the bottom
is gh2irrespective of the angle of inclination.
Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it
acquires a kinetic energy, mgh . If the work done
or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors
such as the velocity or the particular path taken
by the object, the force would be called non-
conservative.
The  dimensions  of  potential  energy are
[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as
kinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change
in potential energy, for a conservative force,
∆V  is equal to the negative of the work done by
the force
∆V = − F(x) ∆x (5.9)
In the example of the falling ball considered in
this section we saw how potential energy was
converted to kinetic energy. This hints at an
important principle of conservation in mechanics,
which we now proceed to examine.
5.8THE CONSER VATION OF MECHANICAL
ENERGY
For simplicity we demonstrate this important
principle for one-dimensional motion. Suppose
that a body undergoes displacement ∆x under
the action of a conservative for ce F. Then fr om
the WE theorem we have,
∆K =  F (x) ∆x
If the force is conservative, the potential energy
function V(x) can be defined such that
− ∆V  =  F( x) ∆x
The above equations imply that
∆K + ∆V = 0
∆(K + V ) = 0 (5.10)which means that K + V , the sum of the kinetic
and potential energies of the body is a constant.
Over the whole path,  
xi to xf, this means that
Ki + V(xi) = Kf  + V(xf) (5.11)
The quantity K +V(x), is called the total
mechanical energy of the system.  Individually
the kinetic energy K  and the potential energy
V(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum
is a constant. The aptness of the term
‘conservative for ce’ is now clear .
Let us consider some of  the definitions of a
conservative force.
lA force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived
from a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation
given by Eq. (5.9). The three-dimensional
generalisation requires the use of a vector
derivative, which is outside the scope of this
book.
lThe work done by the conservative for ce
depends only on the end points. This can be
seen fr om the r elation,
W = Kf – Ki = V (xi) – V(xf)
which depends on the end points.
lA thir d definition states that the work done
by this force in a closed path is zer o.  This is
once  again apparent from Eq. (5.11) since
xi  = xf .
Thus, the principle of conservation of total
mechanical energy can be stated as
The total mechanical energy of a system is
conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are
conservative .
The above discussion can be made more
concrete by considering the example of the
gravitational force once again and that of the
spring force in the next section. Fig. 5.5 depicts
a ball of mass m being dropped from a cliff of
height H.

Further ,
EH = Eh
which implies,
v g(H h)h22= −               (5.11 d)
and is a familiar result from kinematics.
At the height H, the energy is purely potential.
It is partially converted to kinetic at height h  and
is fully kinetic at ground level. This illustrates
the conservation of mechanical ener gy.

the bob : gravity and the tension ( T) in the
string. The latter does no work since the
displacement of the bob is always normal to the
string. The potential energy of the bob is thus
associated with the gravitational force only. The
total mechanical energy E  of the system is
conserved.  W e take the potential ener gy of the
system to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus,

5.9  THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING
The spring force is an example of a variable force
which is conservative. Fig. 5.7 shows a block
attached to a spring and resting on a smooth
horizontal surface.  The other end of the spring
is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light
and may be tr eated as massless.  In an ideal
spring, the spring for ce Fs  is pr oportional to
xwhere x  is the displacement of the block from
the equilibrium position. The displacement could
be either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative
[Fig. 5.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called
Hooke’s law and is mathematically stated as
Fs =  − kx
The constant k is called the spring constant.  Its
unit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k
 is
large and soft if k is small.
Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in
Fig. 5. 7(b). If the extension is xm, the work done by
the spring force is

This expression may also be obtained by

external pulling force F is positive since it
overcomes the spring force.22

The area of the shaded triangle represents

The work done by the spring force in a cyclic
process is zer o.  We have explicitly demonstrated
that the spring force (i) is position dependent
only as first stated by Hooke, ( Fs = − kx); (ii)
does work which only depends on the initial and
final positions, e.g. Eq. (5.17).  Thus, the spring
for
ce is a conservative for ce.
We define the potential ener gy V(x) of the spring
to be zero when block and spring system is in the
equilibrium position.  For an extension (or
compression) x  the above analysis suggests that
V(x)kx2
=2(5.19)
You may easily verify that − dV/dx = −k x, the
spring force.  If the block of mass m in Fig. 5. 7 is
extended to xm and r eleased fr om rest, then its
total mechanical energy at any arbitrary point x,
where x lies between – xm  and + xm, will be given by

Note that k/m  has the dimensions of [T-2] and
our equation is dimensionally correct. The
kinetic energy gets converted to potential energyand vice versa, however, the total mechanical
energy remains constant. This is graphically
depicted in Fig. 5.8.
Example 5. 8  To simulate car accidents, auto
manufacturers study the collisions of moving
cars with mounted springs of different spring
constants.  Consider a typical simulation with
a car of mass 1000 kg moving with a speed
18.0 km/h on a smooth road and colliding
with a horizontally mounted spring of spring
constant 5.25  × 103 N m–1. What is the
maximum compression of the spring  ?
Answer    At maximum compression the kinetic
energy of the car is converted entirely into the
potential energy of the spring.

We obtain

We note that we have idealised the situation.
The spring is considered to be massless. The
surface has been considered to possess
negligible friction. ⊳
We conclude this section by making a few
remarks on conservative forces.
(i)Information on time is absent from the above
discussions. In the example considered
above, we can calculate the compression, but
not the time over which the compression
occurs.  A solution of Newton’s Second Law
for this system is required for temporal
information.
(ii)Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for
example, is a non-conservative force. The
principle of conservation of energy will have
to be modified in this case. This is illustrated
in Example 5.9.
(iii)The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.
It is set according to convenience.  For the
spring force we took V(x) = 0, at  x = 0, i.e. the
unstretched spring had zero potential
energy.  For the constant gravitational force
mg, we took V = 
0  on the earth’s surface.  In
a later chapter we shall see that for the force
due to the universal law of gravitation, the
zero is best defined at an infinite distance
from the gravitational sour ce. However , once
the zero of the potential energy is fixed in a
given discussion, it must be consistently
adher ed to thr oughout the discussion. Y ou
cannot change horses in midstream !
Example 5. 9   Consider Example 5. 8 taking
the coefficient of friction, µ, to be 0.5 and
calculate the  maximum compression of the
spring.
Answer  In presence of friction, both the spring
force and the frictional force act so as to oppose
the compression of the spring as shown in
Fig. 5.9.
We invoke the work-energy theor em, rather
than the conservation of mechanical energy.
The change in kinetic energy isFig. 5.9  The forces acting on the car .

Now  µmg  = 0.5 × 103 × 10 = 5 × 103 N (taking
g =10.0 m s-2). After rearranging the above
equatio n we obtain the following quadratic
equation in the unknown xm.
22 2
m m k x m g x m v 0+ − =µ
where we take the positive square root since
xm is positive. Putting in numerical values we
obtain
xm  = 1.35 m
which, as expected, is less than the result in
Example 5.8.
If the two forces on the body consist of a
conservative force Fc and a non-conservative
force  Fnc , the conservation of mechanical energy
formula will have to be modified. By the WE
theorem
(Fc+ Fnc) ∆x = ∆K
But     Fc ∆x = − ∆V
Hence,             ∆(K + V ) = Fnc ∆x
                       ∆E    = Fnc ∆x
where E  is the total mechanical energy. Over
the path this assumes the form

Answer  The downward force on the elevator is
F = m g  + Ff = (1800 × 10) + 4000 = 22000 N
The motor must supply enough power to balance
this force.  Hence,

5.11  COLLISIONS
In physics we study motion (change in position).
At the same time, we try to discover physical
quantities, which do not change in a physical
process. The laws of momentum and energy
conservation are typical examples. In this
section we shall apply these laws to a commonly
encountered phenomena, namely collisions.
Several games such as billiards, marbles or
carrom involve collisions.W e shall study the
collision of two masses in an idealised form.
Consider two masses m1 and m2.  The particle
m1 is moving with speed v1i , the subscript ‘i ’
implying initial. W e can cosider m2  to be at r est.
No loss of generality is involved in making such
a selection. In this situation the  mass m1
collides  with  the stationary  mass m2  and  this
is depicted in  Fig. 5.10.
Fig. 5. 10 Collision of mass m1, with a stationary mass m2.
The masses m1 and m2 fly-off in different
directions.  W e shall see that ther e are
relationships, which connect the masses, the
velocities and the angles.uunlike the conservative force, Wnc  depends on
the particular path i  to  f. ⊳
5.10  POWER
Often it is interesting to know not only the work
done on an object, but also the rate at which
this work is done. W e say a person is physically
fit if he not only climbs four floors of a building
but climbs them fast. Power is defined as the
time rate at which work is done or energy is
transferred.
The average power of a force is defined as the
ratio of the work, W, to the total time t taken
PW
tav=
The instantaneous power is defined as the
limiting value of the average power as time
interval approaches zero,
d
dWPt= (5.20)
The work dW done by a force F for a displacement
dr is dW = F.dr.  The instantaneous power can
also be expressed as
d
dPt=F.r
= F.v (5.21)
where v is the instantaneous velocity when the
force is F.
Power , like work and ener gy, is a scalar
quantity.  Its dimensions are [ML2T–
3]. In the SI,
its unit is called a watt (W).  The watt is 1 J s–1.
The unit of power is named after James W att,
one of the innovators of the steam engine in the
eighteenth century.
There is another unit of power , namely the
horse-power (hp)
1 hp = 746 W
This unit is still used to describe the output of
automobiles, motorbikes, etc.
We encounter the unit watt when we buy
electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and
refrigerators.  A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10
hours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.
100 (watt) × 10 (hour)
= 1000 watt hour
=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)
= 103 (W) × 3600 (s)
= 3.6 × 106 J

5.11.1   Elastic and  Inelastic Collisions
In all collisions the total linear momentum is
conserved; the initial momentum of the system
is equal to the final momentum of the system.
One can argue this as follows.  When two objects
collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over
the collision time ∆t cause a change in their
respective momenta :
∆p1 = F12  ∆t
∆p2 = F21  ∆t
where F12 is  the force exerted on the first particle
by the second particle. F21 is likewise the force
exerted on the second particle by the first particle.
Now from Newton’s third law, F12 = − F21.  This
implies
∆p1 + ∆p2 =  0
The above conclusion is true even though the
forces vary in a complex fashion during the
collision time ∆t. Since the third law is true at
every instant, the total impulse on the first object
is equal and opposite to that on the second.
On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of
the system is not necessarily conserved. The
impact and deformation during collision may
generate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic
energy is transformed into other forms of energy.
A useful way to visualise  the deformation during
collision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring ’. If
the ‘spring ’ connecting the two masses regains
its original shape without loss in energy , then
the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final
kinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the
collision time ∆t is not constant. Such a collision
is called an elastic collision . On the other hand
the deformation may not be relieved and the two
bodies could move together after the collision. A
collision in which the two particles move together
after the collision is called a completely inelastic
collision . The intermediate case where the
deformation is partly relieved and some of the
initial kinetic energy is lost is more common and
is appropriately called an inelastic collision .
5.11.2   Collisions in One Dimension

in one dimension. Then,  in Fig. 5.10,

of our analysis are interesting.
Case I :  If the two masses are equal
v1f = 0
v2f =  v1i
The first mass comes to rest and pushes off the
second mass with its initial speed on collision.
Case II :  If one mass dominates, e.g. m2 > > m1
v1f  ~ − v1i      v2f ~ 0
The heavier mass is undisturbed while the
lighter mass reverses its velocity.

In a nuclear reactor a neutron of high

to 103 m s–1 so that it can have a high
probability of interacting with isotope 92235U
and causing it to fission. Show that a
neutron can lose most of its kinetic energy

One can also verify this result by substituting

For deuterium m2 = 2m1 and we obtain
f1 = 1/9  while f2 = 8/9.  Almost 90% of the
neutron’s energy is transferred to deuterium. For
carbon f1 = 71.6% and f2 = 28.4%.  In practice,
however , this number is smaller since head-on
collisions are rare. ⊳
If the initial velocities and final velocities of
both the bodies are along the same straight line,
then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or
head-on collision.  In the case of small spherical
bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel
of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2
which is at rest. In general, the collision is two-dimensional, where the initial velocities and the
final velocities lie in a plane.
5.11.3  Collisions in Two Dimensions
Fig. 5.10 also depicts the collision of a moving
mass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear
momentum is conserved in such a collision.
Since momentum is a vector this implies three
equations for the three directions { x, y, z }.
Consider the plane determined by the final
velocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to
be the x-y plane. The conservation of the
z-component of the linear momentum implies
that the entire collision is in the x-y 
plane. The
x- and y-component equations are
m1v1i = m1v1f cos θ 1 + m2v2f cos θ 2     (5.28)
0  = m1v1f  sin θ1 −  m2v2f sin θ2        (5.29)
One knows { m1, m2, v1i} in most situations.  There
are thus four unknowns { v1f, v2f, θ1 and θ2}, and
only two equations. If θ 1 = θ 2 = 0, we regain
Eq. (5.23) for one dimensional collision.
If, further the collision is elastic,
2 2 2

We obtain an additional equation. That still
leaves us one equation short.  At least one of
the four unknowns, say θ 1, must be made known
for the problem to be solvable. For example, θ1
can be determined by moving a detector in an
angular fashion from the x  to the y  axis. Given
{m1, m2, v1i, θ1} we can determine { v1f, v2f, θ2}
from Eqs. (5.28)-(5.30).
Example 5.12  Consider the collision
depicted in Fig. 5.10 to be between two
billiard balls with equal masses  m1 = m2.
The first  ball  is  called the cue while the
second ball is called the target. The
billiard player wants to ‘sink’ the target
ball in a corner pocket, which is at an
angle θ2 = 37°. Assume that the collision is
elastic and that friction and rotational
motion are not important.  Obtain θ 1.

Comparing Eqs. (5.31) and (5.32), we get
cos (θ1 + 37°) = 0
orθ1 + 37°  = 90°
Thus,    θ1 = 53°
This proves the following result :  when two equal
masses undergo a glancing elastic collision with
one of them at rest, after the collision, they will
move at right angles to each other .                ⊳The matter simplifies greatly if we consider
spherical masses with smooth surfaces, and
assume that collision takes place only when the
bodies touch each other . This is what happens
in the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.
In our everyday world, collisions take place only
when two bodies touch each other . But consider
a comet coming from far distances to the sun, or
alpha particle coming towards a nucle us and
going away in some direction. Here we have to
deal with forces involving action at a distance.
Such an event is called scattering. The velocities
and directions in which the two particles go away
depend on their initial velocities as well as the
type of interaction between them, their masses,
shapes and sizes.
SUMMARY
1.The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work
done by the net force on the body.
Kf - Ki = Wnet
2.A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and
depends only on the end points { xi, xj}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an
arbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.

such that

4.The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical
energy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.
5.The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth’s
surface is
V(x) = m g x
where the variation of g with height is ignored.

7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as A.B  and is a scalar
quantity given by : A.B = AB cos θ,  where θ  is the angle between A and B.  It can be
positive, negative or zero depending upon the value of θ. The scalar product of two
vectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component
of the other vector along the first vector . For unit vectors :

1.The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. W e should r efer (or imply
clearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a

2.Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and
kinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction
or viscous force on a moving body is negative.
3.For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from
Newton’s Third Law,
F12  +  F21  =  0
But the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.
W12  + W21  ≠  0
However , it may sometimes be true.
4.The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of
the force is not known. This is clear from Example 5.2 where the WE theorem is
used in such a situation.
5.The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem
may be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation
of mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for
conservative forces.
5.The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-
inertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the
net force acting on the body under consideration.
7.The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always
undetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential
energy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mg h,
the zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring
potential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position
of the oscillating mass.
8.Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential
energy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no
potential energy can be associated with friction.
9.During a collision  : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of
the collision  ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)
applies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.
In fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may  be momentarily at rest
with r espect to each other .
