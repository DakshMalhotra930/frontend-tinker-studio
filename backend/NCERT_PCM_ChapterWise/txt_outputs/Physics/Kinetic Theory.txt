CHAPTER  TWELVE
KINETIC THEORY
12.1 INTRODUCTION
Boyle discovered the law named after him in 1661. Boyle,
Newton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of
gases by considering that gases ar e made up of tiny atomic
particles. The actual atomic theory got established mor e than
150 years later . Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases
based on the idea that the gas  consists of rapidly moving
atoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter -atomic for ces,
which are short range for ces that ar e important for solids
and liquids,  can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory
was developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell,
Boltzmann and others. It has been r emarkably successful. It
gives a molecular interpr etation of  pr essur e and temperatur e
of a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and A vogadr o’s
hypothesis. It corr ectly explains specific heat capacities of
many gases. It also r elates measurable pr operties of gases
such as viscosity, conduction and dif fusion with molecular
parameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.
This chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.
12.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER
Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century
considers the discovery that “Matter is made up of atoms” to
be a very significant one. Humanity may suf fer annihilation
(due to nuclear catastr ophe) or extinction (due to
envir onmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that
happens, and all of scientific knowledge wer e to be destr oyed
then Feynman would like the ‘Atomic Hypothesis’ to be
communicated to the next generation of cr eatur es in the
universe. Atomic Hypothesis: All things ar e made of atoms -
little particles that move ar ound in perpetual motion,
attracting each other when they ar e a little distance apart,
but r epelling upon being squeezed into one another .
Speculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in
many places and cultur es. Kanada in India and Democritus12.1 Introduction

KINETIC THEORY 245
in Greece had suggested that matter may consist
of indivisible constituents. The scientific ‘Atomic
Theory’  is usually cr edited to John Dalton. He
proposed the atomic  theory to explain the laws
of definite and multiple pr oportions obeyed by
elements when they combine into compounds.
The first law says that any given compound has,
a fixed pr oportion by mass of its constituents.
The second law says that when two elements
form mor e than one compound, for a fixed mass
of one element, the masses of the other elements
are in ratio of small integers.
To explain the laws Dalton suggested, about
200 years ago,  that the smallest constituents
of an element are atoms. Atoms of one element
are identical but dif fer fr om those of other
elements.  A small number of atoms of each
element combine to for m a molecule of the
compound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early
19th century, states:  When gases combine
chemically to yield another gas, their volumes
are in the ratios of small integers.  A vogadr o’s
law  (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all
gases at equal temperatur e and pr essur e have
the same number of molecules.  A vogadr o’s law,
when combined with Dalton’s theory explains
Gay  Lussac’s law.  Since the elements ar e often
in the for m of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory
can also be r eferred to as the molecular theoryof matter . The theory is now well accepted by
scientists. However even at the end of the
nineteenth century ther e wer e famous scientists
who did not believe in atomic theory !
Fr
om many observations, in r ecent times we
now know that  molecules (made up of one or
more atoms) constitute matter . Electr on
micr oscopes  and scanning tunnelling
microscopes enable us to even see them. The
size of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10   m).
In solids, which ar e tightly packed, atoms ar e
spaced about a few  angstr oms (2 Å) apart. In
liquids the separation between atoms is also
about the same.  In liquids the atoms  ar e not
as rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move
around. This enables a liquid to flow.  In gases
the interatomic distances ar e in tens of
angstroms.  The average distance a molecule
can travel without colliding is called the  mean
free path. The mean free path, in gases, is of
the or der of thousands of angstr oms. The atoms
are much fr eer in gases and can travel long
distances without colliding. If they ar e not
enclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and
liquids the closeness makes the interatomic for ce
important. The for ce has a long range attraction
and a short range r epulsion. The atoms attract
when they ar e at a few angstr oms but r epel when
they come closer . The static appearance of a gasAtomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece
Though John Dalton is cr edited with the intr oduction of atomic viewpoint in moder n science, scholars in
ancient India and Gr eece conjectur ed long befor e the existence of atoms and molecules.  In the V aiseshika
school of thought in India founded by Kanada ( Sixth century B.C.) the atomic pictur e was developed in
considerable detail. Atoms wer e thought to be eter nal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter .
It was ar gued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, ther e would be no dif ference between a
mustar d seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms ( Paramanu  — Sanskrit wor d for the
smallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and V ayu (air) that have characteristic
mass and other attributes, wer e propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structur e and
was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to for m dif ferent molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to for m a
diatomic molecule dvyanuka, thr ee atoms for m a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their pr operties depending
upon the natur e and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjectur e
or by methods that ar e not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the
Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the moder n estimate of atomic
size, of the or der of 1 0–10 m.
   In ancient Gr eece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The
word ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Gr eek. Accor ding to him, atoms dif fer fr om each other physically, in
shape, size and other pr operties and this r esulted in the dif ferent pr operties of the substances for med
by their combination.  The atoms of water wer e smooth and r ound and unable to ‘hook’ on to each
other , which is why liquid /water flows easily.   The atoms of earth wer e rough and jagged, so they held
together to for m hard substances.  The atoms of fir e wer e thor ny which is why it caused painful bur ns.
These fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further , perhaps because they
were intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the
hallmark of moder n science.

Tµis misleading. The gas is full of activity and the
equilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic
equilibrium, molecules collide and change their
speeds during the collision. Only the average
properties ar e constant.
Atomic theory is not the end of our quest, but
the beginning. W e now know that atoms ar e not
indivisible or elementary. They consist of a
nucleus and electr ons. The nucleus itself is made
up of protons and neutr ons. The pr otons and
neutr ons ar e again made up of quarks. Even
quarks may not be the end of the story. Ther e
may be string like elementary entities. Natur e
always has surprises for us, but the sear ch for
truth is often enjoyable and the discoveries
beautiful. In this chapter , we shall limit ourselves
to understanding the behaviour of gases (and a
little bit of solids), as a collection of moving
molecules in incessant motion.
12.3   BEHAVIOUR OF GASES
Properties of gases are easier to understand than
those of solids and liquids. This is mainly
because in a gas, molecules ar e far fr om each
other and their mutual interactions ar e
negligible except when two molecules collide.
Gases at low pr essur es and high temperatur es
much above that at which they liquefy (or
solidify) appr oximately satisfy a simple r elation
between their pr essur e, temperatur e and volume
given by (see Chapter 10)
PV = KT (12.1)
for a given sample of the gas. Here T is the
temperature in kelvin or (absolute)  scale. K  is  a
constant for the given sample but varies with
the volume of the gas. If we now  bring in  the
idea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional
to the number of molecules, (say) N in the
sample. W e can write K = N k . Observation tells
us that this k is same for all gases. It is called
Boltzmann constant and is denoted by k
B.
As 1 1 2 2
1 1 2 2P V P V
N T N T=  = constant = kB(12.2)
if P, V and T are same, then N is also same for all
gases. This is Avogadro’s hypothesis, that  the
number of molecules per unit volume is
the same for all gases at a fixed temperature and
pressure. The number in 22.4 litres of any gasis 6.02 × 1023. This is known as Avogadro number
and is denoted by NA. The mass of 22.4 litres of
any gas is equal to its molecular weight in grams
at S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K and
pressure 1 atm). This amount of substance is
called a mole (see Chapter 1 for a more precise
definition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of
numbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed
temperature and pressure from chemical
reactions.  Kinetic  theory justifies this hypothesis.
The perfect gas equation can be written as
PV = µ RT (12.3)
where  µ   is the number of moles and R  = NA
kB is a universal constant. The temperatur e T is
absolute temperature.  Choosing kelvin scale for
absolute temperature, R = 8.314 J mol–1K–1.

M Nµ= = (12.4)
where M is the mass of the gas containing N

can also be written as

where  n is the number density, i.e. number of
molecules per unit volume. kB is  the Boltzmann
constant introduced above. Its value in SI units
is 1.38 ×  10–23 J K–1.
Another useful form of Eq. (12.3) is
0RTPMρ=(12.5)
Reprint 2025-26
KINETIC THEORY 247⊳where ρ is the mass density of the gas.
A gas that satisfies Eq. (12.3) exactly at all
pressur es and temperatur es is defined to be an
ideal gas . An ideal gas is a simple theor etical
model of a gas. No r eal gas is truly ideal.
Fig. 12.1 shows departures from ideal gas
behaviour for a r eal gas at thr ee dif ferent
temperatures. Notice that all curves appr oach
the ideal gas behaviour for low  pr essur es and
high temperatur es.
At low pressur es or high temperatur es the
molecules ar e far apart and molecular
interactions ar e negligible. W ithout interactions
the gas behaves like an ideal one.
If we fix µ and T in Eq. (12.3), we get
PV = constant (12.6)
i.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of
a given mass of gas varies inversely with volume.
This is the famous Boyle’s law . Fig. 12.2  shows
comparison between experimental P-V curves
and the theor etical curves predicted by Boyle’s
law. Once again you see that the  agr eement is
good at high temperatur es and  low pr essur es.
Next, if you fix P, Eq. (12.1) shows that V ∝  T i.e.,
for a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is
proportional to its absolute temperatur e T
(Charles’ law) . See Fig. 12.3.
Fig.12.2 Experimental P-V curves (solid lines) for
steam at three temperatures compared with
Boyle’s law (dotted lines). P is in units of 22
atm and V in units of 0.09 litres.
Finally, consider a mixtur e of non-interacting
ideal  gases: µ
1  moles of gas 1, µ
2 moles of gas 2,etc. in a vessel of volume V at temperature T and
pressur e P. It is then found that the equation  of
state of the mixture is :
PV = ( µ1 + µ2 +…  ) RT (12.7)
i.e. 1 2 ...RT RTPV Vµ µ= + + (12.8)
= P1 + P2 + … (12.9)
Clearly P1 =    µ1 R T/V    is the pressur e that
gas 1 would  exert at the same conditions of
volume and  temperature if no other gases were
present. This is called the partial pressure of the
gas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal
gases is the sum of partial pr essur es. T his is
Dalton’s law of partial pressures.

at three pressures compared with Charles’
law (dotted lines). T is in units of 300 K and
V in units of 0.13 litres.
We next consider some examples which give
us infor mation about the volume occupied by
the molecules and the volume of a single
molecule.
Example 12.1  The density of water is  1000
kg m–3. The density of water vapour at 100 °C
and 1 atm pr essur e is 0.6 kg m–3. The
volume of a molecule multiplied by the total
number gives ,what is called, molecular
volume. Estimate the ratio (or fraction) of
the molecular volume  to the total volume
occupied by the water vapour under the
above conditions of temperatur e and
pressur e.
Reprint 2025-26
248 PHYSICS⊳
⊳Answer  For  a given mass of water molecules,
the density is less if volume is large. So the
volume of the vapour is  1000/0.6  = 1/(6 × 10 -4 )
times lar ger.  If densities of bulk water and water
molecules are same, then the fraction of
molecular volume to the total volume in liquid
state is 1. As volume in vapour state has
increased, the fractional volume is less by the
same amount, i.e.  6× 10-4.  ⊳
Example 12.2   Estimate the volume of a
water molecule using the data in Example
12.1.
Answer  In the liquid (or solid) phase, the
molecules of water ar e quite closely packed. The
density of water molecule may therefore, be
regarded as roughly equal to the density of bulk
water = 1000 kg m–3. To estimate the volume of
a water molecule, we need to know the mass of
a single water molecule. W e know that 1 mole
of water has a mass appr oximately equal to
(2 + 16)g  = 18 g  =  0.018 kg.
Since 1 mole   contains  about   6 × 1023
molecules   (A vogadr o’s  number),   the mass of
a molecule of water is  (0.018)/(6 × 1023) kg  =
3 × 10–26 kg. Therefore, a rough estimate of the
volume of a water  molecule is as follows :
Volume of a water molecule
= (3 × 10–26 kg)/ (1000 kg m–3)
= 3 × 10–29 m3
= (4/3) π  (Radius)3
Hence, Radius ≈ 2 ×10-10  m = 2 Å ⊳
Example 12.3    What is the average
distance between atoms (interatomic
distance) in water? Use the data given in
Examples 12.1 and 12.2.
Answer  :   A given mass of water in vapour state
has 1.67×103 times the volume of the same mass
of water in liquid state (Ex. 12.1). This is also
the increase in the amount of volume available
for each molecule of water . When volume
increases by 103 times the radius increases by
V1/3 or 10 times, i.e., 10 × 2 Å  = 20 Å. So the
average distance is 2 × 20 = 40  Å.    ⊳
Example 12.4 A vessel contains two non-
reactive gases : neon (monatomic) and
oxygen (diatomic). The ratio of their partial
pressures is 3:2. Estimate the ratio of  (i)number of molecules and (ii) mass density
of neon and oxygen in the vessel. Atomic
mass of Ne = 20.2 u, molecular mass of O2
= 32.0 u.
Answer  Partial pr essur e of a gas in a mixtur e is
the pr essur e it would have for the same volume
and temperatur e if it alone occupied the vessel.
(The total pr essur e of a mixtur e of non-r eactive
gases is the sum of partial pr essur es due to its
constituent gases.) Each gas (assumed ideal)
obeys the gas law. Since V  and T are common to
the two gases,  we  have  P1V = µ 1 RT and P2V =
µ2 RT, i.e. ( P1/P2) = (µ1 / µ2). Her e 1 and 2 refer
to neon and oxygen r espectively. Since ( P1/P2) =
(3/2) (given), ( µ1/ µ2) = 3/2.
(i)By definition µ1 = (N1/NA ) and µ2 = (N2/NA)
where N1 and N2 are the number of molecules
of 1 and 2, and NA is the A vogadr o’s number .
Therefore, (N1/N2) = (µ1 / µ2)  = 3/2.
(ii)We can also write µ1 = (m1/M1) and µ2 =
(m2/M2) wher e m1 and m2 are the masses of
1 and 2; and M1 and M2 are their molecular
masses. (Both m1 and M1; as well as m2 and
M2 should be expr essed in the same units).

12.4 KINETIC THEORY OF AN IDEAL GAS
Kinetic theory of gases is based on the molecular
pictur e of matter . A given amount of gas is a
collection of a lar ge number of molecules
(typically of the or der of A vogadr o’s number) that
are in incessant random motion. At or dinary
pressur e and temperatur e, the average distance
between molecules is a factor of 10 or mor e than
the typical size of a molecule (2 Å). Thus,
interaction between molecules is negligible and
we can assume that they move freely in straight
lines accor ding to Newton’s first law. However ,
occasionally, they come close to each other ,
experience intermolecular forces and their
velocities change.  These interactions are called
collisions. The molecules collide incessantly
against each other or with the walls and change
⊳
Reprint 2025-26
KINETIC THEORY 249
their velocities.  The collisions are considered to
be elastic. W e can derive an expr ession for the
pressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory.
We begin with the idea that molecules of a
gas ar e in incessant random motion, colliding
against one another and with the walls of the
container . All collisions between molecules
among themselves or between molecules and the
walls ar e elastic. This implies that  total kinetic
energy is conserved. The total momentum is
conserved as usual.
12.4.1 Pressure of an Ideal Gas
Consider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. T ake
the axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube,
as shown in Fig. 12.4.  A molecule with velocity
(vx, vy, vz ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz-
plane of ar ea A (= l2). Since the collision is elastic,
the molecule r ebounds with the same velocity;
its y and z components of velocity do not change
in the collision but the x-component r everses
sign. That is, the velocity after collision is
(-vx, vy, vz ) . The change in momentum of the
molecule is:  – mvx – (mvx) = – 2 mvx . By the
principle of conservation of momentum, the
momentum imparted to the wall in the collision
= 2mvx .the wall. Thus, the number of molecules with
velocity (vx, vy, vz )  hitting the wall in time ∆t is
½A vx  ∆t n, where n is the number of molecules
per unit volume. The total momentum
transferr ed to the wall by these molecules in
time ∆t  is:
Q = (2mvx) (½ n A vx 
∆t ) (12.10)
The force on the wall is the rate of momentum
transfer Q/∆t  and pr essur e is for ce per unit
area :
P =  Q /(A ∆t)  =  n m vx2(12.11)
Actually, all molecules in a gas do not have
the same velocity; ther e is a distribution in
velocities.  The  above equation, therefore, stands
for pressure du e to the group of molecules with
speed vx  in  the x-direction and n stands for the
number density of that group of molecules. The
total  pressure is obtained by summing over the
contribution due to all gr oups:
P = n m  2
xv (12.12)
where2
xv is the average of  vx2  .  Now the gas
is isotr opic, i.e. ther e is no pr eferred dir ection
of velocity of the molecules in the vessel.
Therefore, by symmetry,
2
xv = 2
yv = 2
zv
= (1/3) [2
xv +  2
yv + 2
zv] = (1/3) 2v (12.13)
where v is the speed and 2v  denotes the mean
of the squar ed speed. Thus
P = (1/3) n m  2v (12.14)
Some remarks on this derivation. First,
though we choose the container to be a cube,
the shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For
a vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose
a small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry
through the steps above. Notice that both A and
∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s
law, given in Ch. 9,  pressure in one portion of
the gas  in equilibrium is the same as anywhere
else. Second, we have ignored any collisions in
the derivation. Though this assumption is
difficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively
see that it will not lead to erroneous results. The
number of molecules hitting the wall in time ∆t
was found to be ½ n  Avx ∆t. Now the collisions
are random and the gas is in a steady state.
Thus, if a molecule with velocity ( vx, vy, vz )
acquires a  different velocity due to collision with
some molecule, there will always be some otherFig. 12.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with the
wall of the container .
To calculate the force (and pressure) on the
wall, we need to calculate momentum imparted
to the wall per unit time. In a small time interval
∆t, a molecule with x-component of velocity vx
will hit the wall if it is within the distance vx ∆t
from the wall. That is, all molecules within the
volume Avx ∆t only can hit the wall in time ∆t.
But, on the average, half of these are moving
towards the wall and the other half away from
Reprint 2025-26
250 PHYSICS⊳molecule with a different initial velocity which
after a collision acquires the velocity  ( vx, vy, vz ).
If this were not so, the distribution of velocities
would not r emain steady. In any case we ar e
finding 2
xv. Thus, on the whole, molecular
collisions (if they ar e not too fr equent and the
time spent in a collision is  negligible compar ed
to time between collisions)  will not af fect the
calculation above.
12.4.2  Kinetic Interpretation of Temperature
Equation (13.14) can be written as
PV   =  (1/3) nV m  2v (12.15a)
PV   =   (2/3) N x ½ m 2v (12.15b)
where N (= nV) is the number of molecules in
the sample.
The quantity in the bracket is the average
translational kinetic ener gy of the molecules in
the gas. Since the inter nal ener gy E of an ideal
gas is pur ely kinetic
*,
E = N × (1/2) m 2v (12.16)
Equation (12.15) then gives :
PV = (2/3) E (12.17)
We are now r eady for a kinetic interpr etation
of temperature. Combining Eq. (12.17) with the
ideal gas Eq. (12.3), we get
E 
= (3/2)  kB  NT                                             (12.18)
or  E/ N  = ½  m  2v   =   (3/2) kBT (12.19)
i.e., the average kinetic energy of a molecule is
proportional to the absolute temperatur e of the
gas; it is independent of pr essur e, volume or
the natur e of the ideal gas. This is a fundamental
result relating temperature, a macroscopic
measurable parameter of a gas
(a ther modynamic variable as it is called) to a
molecular quantity, namely the average kinetic
energy of a molecule. The two domains are
connected by the Boltzmann constant. W e note
in passing that Eq. (12.18) tells us that internal
ener gy of an ideal gas depends only on
temperatur e, not on pr essur e or volume. W ith
this interpr etation of temperatur e, kinetic theory
of an ideal gas is completely consistent with the
ideal gas equation and the various gas laws
based on it.
For a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the
total pressure gets contribution from each gas
in the mixture. Equation (12.14) becomesP = (1/3) [ n1m12
1v + n2 m2 2
2v+…  ] (12.20)
In equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of
the molecules of different gases will be equal.
That is,
½  m1 2
1v = ½ m2 2
2v= (3/2) kB T
so that
P = (n1 + n2 +…  ) kB T (12.21)
which is Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
From Eq. (12.19), we can get an idea of the
typical speed of molecules in a gas. At a
temperatur e T = 300 K, the mean squar e speed
of a molecule in nitr ogen gas is :
2 –26
26284.65 106.02 10N
AMmN= = = ×× kg.
2v  =  3 kB T / m    =    (516)2 m2s-2
The squar e root of 2v is known as r oot mean
squar e (rms) speed and is denoted by vrms,
( We can also write    2v    as   < v2 >.)
vrms   =    516 m s-1
The speed is of the or der of the speed of sound
in air. It follows fr om Eq. (12.19) that at the same
temperatur e, lighter molecules have gr eater r ms
speed.
Example 12.5  A flask contains argon and
chlorine in the ratio of 2:1 by mass.  The
temperatur e of the mixtur e is 27 °C. Obtain
the ratio of  (i) average kinetic ener gy per
molecule, and (ii) r oot mean squar e speed
vrms of the molecules of the two gases.
Atomic mass of ar gon = 39.9 u; Molecular
mass of chlorine = 70.9 u.
Answer The important point to remember is that
the average kinetic energy (per molecule) of any
(ideal) gas (be it monatomic like argon, diatomic
like chlorine or polyatomic) is always equal to
(3/2) kBT. It depends only on temperature, and
is independent of the nature of the gas.
(i)Since argon and chlorine both have the same
temperature in the flask, the ratio of average
kinetic energy (per molecule) of the two gases
is 1:1.
(ii)Now  ½ m vrms2  =  average kinetic energy per
molecule =  (3/2) ) kBT where m  is the mass

calculation. Any other proportion by mass of
argon and chlorine would give the same answers
to (i) and (ii), pr ovided the temperatur e remains
unalter ed. ⊳
Example 12.6    Uranium has two isotopes
of masses 235 and 238 units. If both ar e
present in Uranium hexafluoride gas which
would have the  lar ger average speed ? If
atomic mass of fluorine is 19 units,
estimate the per centage dif ference in
speeds at any temperatur e.
Answer   At a fixed temperature the average
energy  = ½ m  <v2 > is constant. So  smaller the
mass of the molecule, faster will be the speed.
The ratio of speeds is inversely proportional to
the square root of the ratio of the masses. The
masses are 349 and 352 units. So
v349 / v352  =   ( 352/ 349)1/2 = 1.0044 .
Hence difference V
VΔ= 0.44 %.
[235U is the isotope needed for nuclear fission.
To separate it fr om the mor e abundant isotope
238U,  the mixtur e  is surr ounded by a  por ous
cylinder . The por ous cylinder must be thick and
narrow, so that the molecule wanders thr ough
individually, colliding with the walls of the long
pore. The faster molecule will leak out mor e than
the slower one and so there is more of the lighter
molecule (enrichment) outside the por ous
cylinder (Fig. 12.5). The method is not very
efficient and has to be r epeated several times
for sufficient enrichment.]. ⊳
When gases diffuse, their rate of diffusion is
inversely proportional to square root of the
masses (see Exercise 12.12 ). Can you guess the
explanation from the above answer?Fig. 12.5  Molecules going through a porous wall.
Example 12.7   (a)  When a molecule (or an
elastic ball) hits a ( massive) wall, it
rebounds with the same speed. When a ball
hits a massive bat held fir mly, the same
thing happens. However , when the bat is
moving towards the ball, the ball rebounds
with a different speed. Does the ball move
faster or slower? (Ch.5 will refresh your
memory on elastic collisions.)
(b) When gas in a cylinder is compressed
by pushing in a piston, its temperatur e
rises. Guess at an explanation of this in
terms of kinetic theory using (a) above.
(c) What happens when a compr essed gas
pushes a piston out and expands. What
would you observe ?
(d) Sachin Tendulkar used a heavy cricket
bat while playing. Did it help him in
anyway ?
Answer   (a)  Let the speed of the ball be u  relative
to the wicket behind the bat. If the bat is moving
towards the ball with a speed V  relative to the
wicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat
is V + u  towards the bat. When the ball rebounds
(after hitting the massive bat) its speed,  relative
to bat,  is V + u  moving away from the bat. So
relative to the wicket the speed of the rebounding
ball is V + (V + u) = 2V + u, moving away from the
wicket. So the ball speeds up after the collision
with the bat. The rebound speed will be less than
u if the bat is not massive. For a molecule this
would imply an increase in temperature.

A molecule free to move in space needs three
coordinates to specify its location. If it is
constrained to move in a plane it needs two; and
if constrained to move along a line, it needs just
one coor dinate to locate it. This can also be
expressed in another way. W e say that it has
one degr ee of fr eedom for motion in a line, two
for motion in a plane and thr ee for motion in
space. Motion of a body as a whole fr om one
point to another is called translation. Thus, a
molecule fr ee to move in space has three
translational degr ees of fr eedom. Each
translational degree of freedom contributes a
term that contains square of some variable of
motion, e.g., ½ mvx2  and similar ter ms in
vy and vz. In, Eq. (12.24) we see that in thermal
equilibrium, the average of each such term is
½ kBT .
Molecules of a monatomic gas like argon have
only translational degrees of freedom. But what
about a diatomic gas such as O2 or N2? A
molecule of O2 has thr ee translational degr ees
of freedom. But in addition it can also r otate
about its centre of mass. Figure 12.6 shows the
two independent axes of r otation 1 and 2, nor malto the axis joining the two oxygen atoms about
which the molecule can rotate *. The molecule
thus has two r otational degr ees of fr eedom, each
of which contributes a ter m to the total ener gy
consisting of translational energy tε and
rotational ener gy εr.

*Rotation along the line joining the atoms has very small moment of inertia and does not come into play for
quantum mechanical reasons. See end of section 12.6.Fig. 12.6 The two independent axes of rotation of
a diatomic molecule
where ω1 and ω2  are the angular speeds about
the axes 1 and 2 and I1, I2 are the corresponding
moments of inertia. Note that each rotational
degree of freedom contributes a term to the
energy that contains square of a rotational
variable of motion.
We have assumed above that the O2 molecule
is a ‘rigid rotator’, i.e., the molecule does not
vibrate. This assumption, though found to be
true (at moderate temperatures) for O2, is not
always valid. Molecules, like CO, even at
moderate temperatures have a mode of
vibration, i.e., its atoms oscillate along the
interatomic axis like a one-dimensional
oscillator , and contribute a vibrational ener gy

Eq. (12.26) contain squared terms of vibrational
variables of motion y and d y/dt .

KINETIC THEORY 253
At this point, notice an important feature in
Eq.(12.26). While each translational and
rotational degree of freedom has contributed only
one ‘squared term’ in Eq.(12.26), one vibrational
mode contributes two ‘squared terms’ : kinetic
and potential energies.
Each quadratic term occurring in the
expression for energy is a mode of absorption of
energy by the molecule. W e have seen that in
thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,
for each translational mode of motion, the
average energy is ½ kBT. The most elegant
principle of classical statistical mechanics (first
proved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each
mode of energy: translational, rotational and
vibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total
energy is equally distributed in all possible
energy modes, with each mode having an average
energy equal to  ½ kBT. This is known as the law
of equipartition of energy . Accordingly, each
translational and rotational degree of freedom
of a molecule contributes ½ kBT  to the energy,
while each vibrational frequency contributes
2 × ½ kBT  = kBT ,  since a vibrational mode has
both kinetic and potential energy modes.
The proof of the law of equipartition of energy
is beyond the scope of this book. Here, we shall
apply the law to predict the specific heats of gases
theor etically. Later , we shall also discuss briefly,
the application to specific heat  of solids.
12.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY
12.6.1 Monatomic Gases
The molecule of a monatomic gas has only thr ee
translational degr ees of fr eedom. Thus, the
average ener gy of a molecule at temperatur e
T is (3/2) kBT .  The total internal energy of a mole
of such a gas is

As explained earlier , a diatomic molecule tr eated
as a rigid r otator , like a dumbbell, has 5 degr ees
of freedom: 3 translational and 2 rotational.
Using the law of equipartition of ener gy, the total
internal ener gy of a mole of such a gas is

12.6.3 Polyatomic Gases
In general a polyatomic molecule has 3
translational, 3 r otational degrees of freedom
and a certain number (f) of vibrational modes.

it is easily seen that one mole of such a gas has

Table 12.1 summarises the theoretical
predictions for specific heats of gases ignoring

specific heats of several gases given in Table 1 2.2.
Of course, there are discrepancies between
predicted and actual values of specific heats of
several other gases (not shown in the table), such
as Cl2, C2H6 and many other polyatomic gases.
Usually, the experimental values for specific
heats of these gases ar e greater than the
predicted values as given in Table12.1 suggesting
that the agreement can be improved by including
vibrational modes of motion in the calculation.
The  law of equipartition of energy is, thus, w ell
verified experimentally at ordinary temperatures.

Example 12.8  A cylinder of fixed capacity
44.8 litres contains helium gas at standard
temperature and pressure. What is the
amount of heat needed to raise the
temperature of the gas in the cylinder by
15.0 °C ? (R = 8.31 J mo1–1 K–1).Answer  Using the gas law PV = µRT, you can
easily show that 1 mol of any (ideal) gas at
standar d temperatur e (273 K) and pr essur e
(1 atm = 1.01 × 105 Pa) occupies a volume of  22.4
litres. This universal volume is called molar
volume. Thus the cylinder in this example
contains 2 mol of helium. Further , since helium
is monatomic, its pr edicted (and observed) molar
specific heat at constant volume, Cv = (3/2) R,
and molar specif ic heat at constant pr essur e,
Cp = (3/2) R + R = (5/2) R.  Since the volume of
the cylinder is fixed, the heat required is
deter mined by Cv. Ther efore,
Heat required = no. of moles × molar specific heat

= 2 × 1.5 R × 15.0 = 45 R
= 45 × 8.31 = 374 J. ⊳
12.6.4   Specific Heat Capacity of Solids
We can use the law of equipartition of ener gy to
deter mine specific heats of solids. Consider a
solid of N  atoms, each vibrating about its mean
position. An oscillation in o ne dimension has
average energy of 2 × ½ kBT = kBT . In three
dimensions, the average energy is 3 kBT. For a
mole of solid, N = NA, and the total
energy is
U =  3  kBT × NA  = 3 RT
Now at constant pressure ∆Q = ∆U + P∆V
= ∆U,  since for a solid  ∆V is negligible. Hence,
 3Q UC RT TΔ Δ= = =Δ Δ(12.37)

solids at room temperature and

As Table 12.3 shows the prediction generally
agrees with experimental values at ordinary
temperature (Carbon is an exception).

KINETIC THEORY 255⊳from a cylinder in a kitchen takes considerable
time to diffuse to the other corners of the room.
The top of a cloud of smoke holds together for
hours. This happens because molecules in a gas
have a finite though small size, so they are bound
to undergo collisions. As a result, they cannot
move straight unhindered; their paths keep
getting incessantly deflected.
Fig. 12.7 The volume swept by a molecule in time ∆t
in which any molecule will collide with it.
Suppose the molecules of a gas are spheres of
diameter d. Focus on a single molecule with the
average speed < v>. It will suffer collision with
any molecule that comes within a distance d
between the centres. In time ∆t, it sweeps a
volume πd2 <v> ∆t wherein any other molecule
will collide with it (see Fig. 12.7). If n is the
number of molecules per unit volume, the
molecule suffers nπd2 <v> ∆t  collisions in time
∆t. Thus the rate of collisions is  nπd2 <v> or the
time between two successive collisions is on the
average,
τ  = 1/( nπ <v> d2 ) (12.38)
The average distance between two successive
collisions, called the mean free path l, is :
l  = <v> τ = 1/(n πd2) (12.39)
In this derivation, we imagined the other
molecules to be at rest. But actually all moleculesare moving and the collision rate is determined
by the average relative velocity of the molecules.
Thus we need to replace < v> by < v
r> in Eq.
(12.38). A more exact treatment gives

Taking, d = 2 × 10–10 m,
τ = 6.1 × 10–10 s
and l = 2.9  × 10–7 m ≈ 1500 d (12.41)
As expected, the mean free path given by
Eq. (12.40) depends inversely on the number
density and the size of the molecules. In a highly
evacuated tube n is rather small and the mean
free path can be as large as the length of the
tube.
Example 12.9  Estimate the mean free path
for a water molecule in water vapour at 373 K.
Use information from Exercises 12.1 and Eq.

of air . The number density is inversely
proportional to absolute temperature.

Note that the mean free path is 100 times the
interatomic distance ~ 40 Å = 4  × 10-9 m calculated
earlier . It is this lar ge value of mean fr ee path that
leads to the typical gaseous behaviour . Gases can
not be confined without a container .
Using, the kinetic theory of gases, the bulk

conductivity and dif fusion can be r elated to the
microscopic parameters like molecular size. It is

SUMMARY
1. The ideal gas equation connectin g pressure ( P), volume ( V) and absolute temperature
(T ) is
                                         PV = µ RT     = kB NT
where  µ is the number of moles and N is the number of molecules. R and kB are universal
constants.

N   = 1.38 ××××× 10–23 J K–1
Real gases satisfy the ideal gas equation only approximately, more so at low pressures

This tells us that  the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of
a molecule,  independent of the nature of the gas or molecule.  In a mixture of gases at a
fixed temperature the heavier molecule has the lower average speed.

This leads to a relation
PV = 2

4. The law of equipartition of energy states that if a system is in equilibrium at absolute
temperatur e T, the total ener gy is distributed equally in dif ferent ener gy modes of
absorption, the energy in each mode being equal to ½ kB T. Each translational and
rotational degree of freedom corresponds to one energy mode of absorption and has
energy ½ kB T. Each vibrational frequency has two modes of energy (kinetic and potential)
with corresponding energy equal to
2 × ×××× ½ 
kB T = kB T.
5. Using the law of equipartition of energy, the molar specific heats of gases can be
determined and the values are in agreement with the experimental values of specific
heats of several gases. The agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes
of motion.

POINTS TO PONDER
1. Pressure of a fluid is not only exerted on the wall. Pressure exists everywhere in a fluid.
Any layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure
is the same on both sides of the layer .
2. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At
ordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance
in solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100 times
the interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule.
3. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energy for each degree of freedom
in thermal equilibrium is ½ k
B T. Each quadratic term in the total energy expression of
a molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives 2
(not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy modes), corresponding to the
energy 2 × ×××× ½ k
B T = k
B T.
4. Molecules of air in a room do not all fall and settle on the ground (due to gravity)
because of their high speeds and incessant collisions. In equilibrium, there is a very
slight increase in density at lower heights (like in the atmosphere). The effect is small
since the potential energy ( mgh) for ordinary heights is much less than the average
kinetic energy ½ mv2 of the molecules.
5. < v2 >  is not always equal to ( < v >)2. The average of a squared quantity is not necessarily
the square of the average. Can you find examples for this statement.
