CHAPTER  THREE
MOTION IN A PLANE
3.1  INTRODUCTION
In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position,
displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to
describe the motion of an object along a straight line. W e
found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be
taken care of by + and – signs, as in one dimension only two
directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an
object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions
(space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-
mentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary
to learn the language of vectors. What is a vecto r? How to
add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of
multiplying a vector by a r eal number ? W e shall lear n this
to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and
acceleration in a plane. W e then discuss motion of an object
in a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall
discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail
the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of
motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.
We shall discuss unifor m cir cular motion in some detail.
The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a
plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.
3.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS
In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or
vectors.  Basically, the difference is that a direction is
associated with a vector but not with a scalar .  A scalar
quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified
completely by a single number , along with the pr oper
unit. Examples are : the distance between two points,
mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the
time at which a certain  event happened.  The rules for
combining scalars are the  rules of ordinary algebra.
Scalars can be added,  subtracted, multiplied and divided3.1 Introduction

just as the ordinary numbers *. For example,
if the length and breadth of a rectangle are
1.0 m and 0.5 m  respectively , then its
perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the
four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =
3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar
and the perimeter is also a scalar . Take
another example: the maximum and
minimum temperatures on a particular day
are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C  respectively .  Then,
the difference between the two temperatures
is 11.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube
of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of
2.7 kg, then its volume is 10–3 m3 (a scalar)
and its density is 2.7 ×103 kg m–3 (a scalar).
A vector  quantity is a quantity that has both
a magnitude and a direction and obeys the
triangle law of addition  or equivalently the
parallelogram law of addition . So, a vector is
specified by giving its magnitude by a number
and its direction. Some physical quantities that
are represented by vectors are displacement,
velocity, acceleration and force.
To represent a vector , we use a bold face type
in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be
represented by a symbol v.  Since bold face is
difficult to produce, when written by hand, a
vector is often represented by an arrow placed
over a letter , say /arrowrightnospv. Thus, both v and /arrowrightnospv
represent the velocity vector . The magnitude of
a vector is often called its absolute value,
indicated by | v| = v.  Thus, a vector is
represented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...
x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light
face A, a, p, q, r , ... x, y .
3.2.1  Position and Displacement Vectors
To describe the posi tion of an object moving in
a plane, we  need to choose a convenient point,
say O as origin. Let P and P ′ be the positions of
the object at time t and t′, respectively [Fig. 3.1(a)].
We join O and P by a straight line.  Then, OP is
the position vector of the object at tim e t.  An
arrow is marked at the head of this line.  It is
represented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r.  Point P′ isrepresented by another position vector , OP′
denoted by r′. The length of the vector r
represents the magnitude of the vector and its
direction is the direction in which P lies as seen
from O. If the object moves from P to P ′, the
vector PP′ (with tail at P and tip at P ′) is called
the displacement vector corresponding to
motion from point P (at time t) to point P ′ (at time t′).
Fig. 3.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors.
(b) Displacement vector PQ and different
     courses of motion.
It is important to note that displacement
vector is the straight line joining the initial and
final positions and does not depend on the actual
path undertaken by the object between the two
positions.  For example, in Fig. 3.1(b), given the
initial and final positions as P and Q, the
displacement vector is the same PQ for different
paths of journey, say PABC Q, PDQ, and PBEF Q.
Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is
either less or equal to the path length of an
object between two points . This fact was
emphasised in the previous chapter also while
discussing motion along a straight line.
3.2.2  Equality of Vectors
Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and
only if, they have the same magnitude and the
same direction. **
Figure 3.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and
B. We can easily check their equality.  Shift B
parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that
of A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then , since  their
tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are
said to be equal.  In general, equality is indicated
*Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However , you can multiply
and divide scalars of different units.
**In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector
unchanged. Such vectors ar e called f ree vectors. However , in some physical applications, location or line of
application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.

as A = B. Note that in Fig. 3.2(b), vectors A′ and
B′ have the same magnitude but they are not
equal because they have different directions.
Even if we shift B′ parallel to itself so that its tail
Q′ coincides with the tail O ′ of A′, the tip S ′ of B′
does not coincide with the tip P ′ of A′.
3.3MULTIPLICA TION OF VECTORS BY REAL
NUMBERS
Multiplying a vector A with a positive number λ
gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by
the factor λ but the direction is the same as that
of A :
λ A = λ A if λ > 0.
For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant
vector 2 A is in the same direction as A and has
a magnitude twice of | A| as shown in Fig. 3.3(a).
Multiplying a vector A by a negative number
−λ gives another vector whose direction is
opposite to the direction of A and whose
magnitude is λ times | A|.
Multiplying a given vector A by negative
numbers, say –1 and –1.5, gives vectors as
shown in Fig 3.3(b).The  factor λ by  which  a vector A is multiplied
could be a scalar having its own physical
dimension. Then, the dimension of λ A is the
product of the dimensions of λ and A. For
example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector
by duration (of time), we get a displacement
vector .
3.4ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF
VECTORS — GRAPHICAL METHOD
As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by
definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently ,
the parallelogram law of addition.  W e shall now
describe this law of addition using  the graphical
method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that
lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a).  The lengths
of the line segments representing these vectors
are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.
To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that
its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in
Fig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head
of B. This line O Q represents a vector R, that is ,
the sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this
procedure of vector addition, vectors areFig. 3.2   (a) Two equal vectors A and B.  (b) Two
vectors A′     and B′ are unequal though they
are of the same length .

arranged head to tail, this graphical method is
called the head-to-tail method . The two vectors
and their resultant form three sides of a triangle,
so this method is also known as triangle method
of vector addition . If we find the resultant of
B + A as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector R is
obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative :
A + B = B + A (3.1)
The addition of vectors also obeys the associative
law as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of
adding vectors A and B first and then adding
vector C is the same as the result of adding B
and C first and then adding vector A :
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (3.2)
What is the result of adding two equal and
opposite vectors ? Consider  two  vectors A and
–A shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is A + (–A).
Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the
same, but the directions are opposite, the
resultant vector has zero magnitude and is
represented by 0 called a null vector  or a zero
vector  :
A – A = 0         |0|= 0 (3.3)
Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its
direction cannot be specified.
The null vector also results when we multiply
a vector A by the number zero. The main
properties of 0 are :
A + 0 = A
λ 0 = 0
0 A = 0        (3.4)
Fig. 3.5  (a)Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B
 from vector A – the result is R2. For
comparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R1 is also shown.What is the physical meaning of a zero vector?
Consider the position and displacement vectors
in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.1(a). Now suppose
that an object which is at P at time t, moves to
P′ and then comes back to P . Then, what is its
displacement? Since the initial and final
positions coincide, the displacement is a “null
vector”.
Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms
of addition of vectors. W e define the dif ference
of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors
A and – B :
A – B = A + (–B) (3.5)
It is shown in Fig 3.5. The vector  –B is added to
vector A to get R2 = (A – B). The vector R1 = A + B
is also shown in the same figure for comparison.
We can also use the parallelogram method to
find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have
two vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we
bring their tails to a common origin O as
shown in Fig. 3.6 (a). Then we draw a line from
the head of A parallel to B and another line from
the head of B parallel to A to complete a
parallelogram O QSP.  Now we join the point of
the intersection of these two lines to the origin
O. The resultant vector R is directed from the
common origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the
parallelogram  [Fig. 3.6 (b)]. In Fig.3.6 (c), the
triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A
and B and we see that the two methods yield the
same result. Thus, the two methods are
equivalent.

Answer   The velocity of the rain and the wind
are represented by the vectors vr and vw in      Fig.

3.5  RESOLUTION OF VECTORS
Let a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a
plane with different directions and let A be
another vector in the same plane (Fig. 3.8). A
can be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one
obtained by multiplying a by a real number and
the other obtained by multiplying b by another
real number . To see this, let O and P be the tail
and head of the vector A. Then, through O, draw
a straight line parallel to a, and thr ough P , a
straight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at
Q. Then, we have
A = OP  = OQ + QP (3.6)
But since OQ is parallel to a, and QP is parallel
to b, we can write :
OQ = λ a, and QP = µ b (3.7)
where  λ and µ are real numbers.
Therefore, A = λ a + µ b (3.8)

a given vector into two component vectors along
a set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same
plane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector
along the axes of a rectangular coordinate
system using vectors of unit magnitude. These
are called unit vectors  that we discuss now. A
unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and
points in a particular direction. It has no
dimension and unit. It is used to specify a
direction only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and
z-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are
denoted by ɵi, ɵj and ˆk, respectively, as shown
in Fig. 3.9(a).
Since these are unit vectors, we have
ˆi   = ˆj = ˆk=1 (3.9)
These unit vectors are perpendicular to each
other . In this text, they ar e printed in bold face
with a cap (^) to distinguish them from other
vectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two
dimensions in this chapter , we r equir e use of
only two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector ,
say ˆn by a scalar , the r esult is a vector
λ λλ λλ = λˆn.  In general, a vector A can be written as
A = |A|ˆn (3.10)
where ˆnis a unit vector along A.
We can now r esolve a vector A in ter ms
of component vectors that lie along unit vectors
iˆ and ɵj.  Consider a vector A that lies in x-y
plane as shown in Fig. 3.9(b). W e draw lines fr om
the head of A perpendicular to the coordinate
axes as in Fig. 3.9(b), and get vectors A1 and A2
such that  A1 + A2 = A. Since A1 is parallel to  ɵiand A2 is parallel to ɵj,  we have :
A1= Ax ɵi,  A2 = Ay ɵj (3.11)
where Ax  and  Ay are real numbers.
Thus,    A = Ax  ɵi+ Ay ɵj              (3.12)
This is represented in Fig. 3.9(c). The quantities
Ax  and Ay  are called x-, and y- components of the
vector A. Note that Ax is itself not a vector , but
Ax ɵi is a vector , and so is Ay ɵj. Using simple
trigonometry, we can express Ax   and Ay in terms
of the magnitude of A and the angle θ it makes
with the x-axis :
Ax  = A cos θ
Ay = A sin θ (3.13)
As is clear from Eq. (3.13), a component of a
vector can be positive, negative or zero
depending on the value of θ.
Now, we have two ways to specify a vector A
in a plane. It can be specified by :
(i)its magnitude A and the direction θ it makes
with the x-axis; or
(ii)its components Ax and Ay
If A and θ  are given,  Ax and Ay  can be obtained
using Eq. (3.13). If Ax  and Ay   are given, A and θ
can be obtained as follows :

Since vectors obey the commutative and

where x and y are components of r along x-, and

by the thick line and is at P at time t and P′ at
time t′ [Fig. 3.1 2(b)].  Then, the displacement is :
∆r  = r′ – r (3.25)
and is directed from P to P ′.
We can write Eq. (3.25) in a component for m:

where ∆x = x ′ – x, ∆y = y′ – y (3.26)

P3 represent the positions of the object  after
times ∆t1,∆t2, and ∆t3. ∆r1,  ∆r2, and ∆r3 are the
displacements of the object in times  ∆t1, ∆t2, and

velocity v  is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for

As in the case of velocity, we can understand
graphically the limiting process used in defining
acceleration on a graph showing the path of the
object’s motion. This is shown in Figs. 3.15(a) to
(d).  P represents the position of the object at
time t and P1, P2, P3 positions  after time ∆t1, ∆t2,
∆t3, respectively ( ∆t 1> ∆t2>∆t3). The velocity vectors
at points P , P1, P2, P3 are also shown in Figs. 3.15
(a), (b) and (c). In each case of ∆t, ∆v is obtained
using the triangle law of vector addition. By
definition, the direction of average   acceleration
is the same as that of ∆v. We see that as ∆t
decreases, the direction of ∆ v changes and
consequently, the direction of the acceleration
changes. Finally, in the limit ∆t g0 [Fig. 3.15(d)],
the average acceleration becomes the
instantaneous acceleration and has the direction
as shown.Fig. 3.14 The components vx and v y of velocity v and
the angle θ it makes with x-axis. Note that

3.9  PROJECTILE MOTION
As an application of the ideas developed in the
previous sections, we consider the motion of a
projectile. An object that is in flight after being
thrown or projected is called a projectile .  Such
a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a
baseball or any other object. The motion of a
projectile may be thought of as the result of two
separate, simultaneously occurring components
of motions. One component is along a horizontal
direction without  any acceleration and the other
along the vertical direction with constant
acceleration due to the force of gravity. It was
Galileo who first stated this independency of the
horizontal and the vertical components of
projectile motion in his Dialogue on the great
world systems  (1632).
In our discussion, we shall assume that the
air resistance has negligible effect on the motion
of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is
launched with velocity vo that makes an angle
θo with  the x-axis as shown in Fig. 3.16.
After the object has been projected, the
acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity
which is directed vertically downward:
a j= −g ɵ
Or, ax = 0, ay = – g       (3.35)

It can be easily verified that the derivative of

One immediate interpretation of Eq.(3.34 b) is that
the  motions in x- and y-directions can be treated
independently of each other .  That is, motion in
a plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two
separate simultaneous one-dimensional
motions with constant acceleration along two
perpendicular directions .  This is an important
result and is useful in analysing motion of objects
in two dimensions . A similar result holds for three
dimensions. The choice of perpendicular
directions is convenient in many physical
situations, as we shall see in section 3. 9 for
projectile motion.
Example 3.5 A particle starts from origin
at t = 0 with a velocity 5.0 î  m/s and moves
in x-y plane under action of a force which
produces a constant acceleration of
(3.0iɵɵɵɵɵ+2.0jɵɵɵɵɵ) m/s2. (a) What is the
y-coordinate of the particle at the instant
its x-coordinate is 84 m ? (b) What is the
speed of the particle at this time ?

MOTION IN A PLANE 39
If we take the initial position to be the origin of
the reference frame as shown in Fig. 3.16, we
have :
xo = 0, yo = 0
Then, Eq.(3.34b) becomes :
x = vox t = (vo cos θo ) t
and y = (vo sin θo ) t – ( ½ )g t2      (3.37)
The components of velocity at time t can be
obtained using Eq.(3.33b) :
vx = vox = vo cos θo
vy = vo sin θo – g t       (3.38)
Equation (3.37) gives the x-, and y-coordinates
of the position of a projectile at time t in terms of
two parameters — initial speed vo and projection
angle θo. Notice that the choice of mutually
perpendicular x-, and y-directions for the
analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in
a simplification. One of the components of
velocity, i.e. x-component remains constant
throughout the motion and only the
y- component changes, like an object in free fall
in vertical direction.  This is shown graphically
at few instants in Fig. 3.17. Note that at the point
of maximum height, vy= 0 and therefore,

Equation of path of a projectile

is of the form y = a x + b x2, in which a and b are
constants.  This is the equation of a parabola,
i.e. the path of the projectile is a parabola
(Fig. 3.17).
Fig. 3.17   The path of a projectile is a parabola.
Time of maximum height
How much time does the projectile take to reach the
maximum height ?  Let this time be denoted by tm.
Since at this point, vy= 0, we have from Eq. (3.38):
vy = vo sinθo – g tm = 0
Or, tm = vo sinθo /g                (3.40a)
The total time Tf  during which the projectile is
in flight can be obtained by putting y = 0 in
Eq. (3.37). W e get :
Tf = 2 (vo sin θo )/g                 (3.40b)
Tf  is known as the  time of flight  of the projectile.
We note that Tf  = 2 tm , which is expected
because of the symmetry of the parabolic path.
Maximum height of a projectile
The maximum height hm reached by the
projectile can be calculated by substituting

Now, for angles, (45°  + α) and ( 45° – α),  2θo is
(90° + 2 α) and  ( 90° – 2 α) , respectively. The
values of  sin (90° + 2 α) and  sin (90° – 2 α) are
the same, equal to that of cos 2 α. Therefore,
ranges are equal for elevations which exceed or
fall short of 45° by equal amounts α.  ⊳
Example 3.7  A hiker stands on the edge
of a cliff 490 m above the ground and
throws a stone horizontally with an initial
speed of 15 m s-1. Neglecting air resistance,
find the time taken by the stone to reach
the ground, and the speed with which it
hits the ground. (Take g = 9.8 m s-2 ).
Answer    We choose the origin of the x-,and y-
axis at the edge of the cliff and t = 0 s at the
instant the stone is thrown. Choose the positive
direction of x-axis to be along the initial velocity
and the positive direction of y-axis to be the
vertically upward direction. The x-, and y-
components of the motion can be treated
independently. The equations of motion are :
x (t)  = xo + vox ty (t)  = yo + voy  t +(1/2)  ay t2
Here, xo = yo = 0, voy = 0, ay =  –g  = –9.8 m s-2,
vox = 15 m s-1.
The stone hits the  ground when y(t) = – 490 m.
– 490 m = –(1/2)(9.8) t2.
This gives     t =10 s.
The velocity components are vx = vox  and
vy = voy – g t
so that when the stone hits the ground :
vox = 15 m s–1
voy = 0 – 9.8 × 10 = – 98 m s–1

3.10  UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION
When an object follows a circular path at a
constant speed, the motion of the object is called
uniform circular motion .  The word “uniform”
refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)
throughout the motion.  Suppose an object is
moving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius
R as shown in Fig. 3.18. Since the velocity of the
object is changing continuously in direction, the
object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the
magnitude and the direction of this acceleration.

MOTION IN A PLANE 41
Let r and r′ be the position vectors and v and
v′ the velocities of the object when it is at point P
and P′ as shown in Fig. 3.18(a).  By definition,
velocity at a point is along the tangent at that
point in the direction of motion. The velocity
vectors v 
and v′ are as shown in Fig. 3.18(a1).
∆v is obtained in Fig. 3.18 (a2) using the triangle
law of vector addition. Since the path is cir cular ,
v is perpendicular to r and so is v′ to r′.
Therefore, ∆v is perpendicular to ∆r. Since
average acceleration is along ∆v av

∆t, the
average acceleration a is perpendicular to ∆r. If
we place ∆ v on the line that bisects the angle
between r and r′, we see that it is directed towards
the centre of the circle. Figure 3.18(b) shows the
same quantities for smaller time interval. ∆v and
hence a is again directed towards the centre.
In Fig. 3.18(c), ∆t0 and the average
acceleration becomes the instantaneous
acceleration. It is directed towards the centre *.
Thus, we find that the acceleration of an object
in uniform circular motion is always directed
towards the centre of the circle. Let us now find
the magnitude of the acceleration.
The magnitude of a is, by definition, given by
av=→ ∆∆
∆ t 0 t
Let the angle between position vectors r andr′ be ∆θ.   Since the velocity vectors v and v′ are
always perpendicular to the position vectors, the
angle between them is also ∆θ . Therefore, the
triangle CP P′ formed by the position vectors and
the triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors
v, v′ and ∆v are similar (Fig. 3.18a).  Therefore,
the ratio of the base-length to side-length for
one of the triangles is equal to that of the other
triangle. That is :

Thus, the acceleration of an object moving with
speed v  in a circle of radius R has a magnitude
v2/R
 and is always directed towards the centre .
This is why t his acceleration is called centripetal
acceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A
thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was
first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was
probably known to Newton also some years earlier .
“Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means
‘centre-seeking’.  Since v and R are constant, the
magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also
constant. However , the dir ection changes —
pointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a
centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector .
We have another way of describing the
velocity and the acceleration of an object  in
uniform circular motion.  As the object moves
from P to P ′ in time Δt (= t′ – t), the line CP
(Fig. 3.18) turns through an angle Δθ  as shown
in the figur e. Δθ  is called angular distance.  W e
define the angular speed ω (Greek letter omega)
as the time rate of change of angular
displacement :

The time taken by an object to make one revolution
is known as its time period T and the number of

the distance moved by the object is s = 2πR.
Therefore, v = 2πR/T =2πRν (3.47)
In terms of frequency ν, we have

the groove steadily and completes 7
revolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the
angular speed, and the linear speed of the
motion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a
constant vector ? What is its magnitude ?
Answer   This is an example of uniform circular
motion. Here R = 12 cm. The angular speed ω is
given by
ω = 2π/T = 2π × 7/100 = 0.44 rad/s
The linear speed v is :
v =ω R = 0.44 s-1 × 12 cm =  5.3 cm s-1
The direction of velocity v is along the tangent
to the circle at every point. The acceleration is
directed towards the centre of the circle. Since
this direction changes continuously,
acceleration her e is not a constant vector .
However , the magnitude of acceleration is
constant:

SUMMARY
1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only.  Examples are distance, speed,
mass and  temperature.
2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and dir ection both.  Examples ar e
displacement, velocity and  acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.
3. A vector A multiplied by a r eal number λ  is also a vector , whose magnitude is λ times
the magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending
upon whether λ is positive or negative.
4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram
method .
5. Vector addition is commutative :
A + B = B + A
It also obeys the associative law :
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude.  Since the magnitude is zero, we
don’t have to specify its direction.  It has the properties :
A + 0 = A
     λ0 = 0
   0 A = 0
7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B :
A – B = A+ (–B)
8. A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the
same plane :
A = λ a + µ b
where λ and µ  are real numbers.
9. A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:
ˆnA
A=
The unit vectors  ɵɵɵi, j, k  are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of
the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.
10. A vector A can be expressed as
A i + j=A Ax yɵɵ
where Ax, Ay are its components along x-, and y -axes.  If vector A makes an angle θ
with the x-axis, then Ax = A cos θ, Ay=A sin θ and  2 2,  tan = .y

11. Vectors can be conveniently added using analytical method .  If sum of two vectors A
and B, that lie in x-y plane, is R, then :
R i j= +R Rx yɵɵ, where,  Rx = Ax + Bx, and     Ry = Ay + By
12. The position vector of an object in x-y plane is given by r = i j x yɵɵ+  and the
displacement from position r to position r’ is given by
∆r = r′− r

16. An object that is in flight after being projected is called a projectile .  If an object is
projected with initial velocity vo making an angle θo with x-axis and if we assume its
initial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position
and velocity of the projectile at time t are given by :
x = (vo cos θo) t
                  y = (vo sin θo) t − (1/2) g t2
vx = vox = vo cos θo
vy = vo sin θo − g t

17. When an object follows a circular path at constant speed, the motion of the object is
called uniform circular motion . The magnitude of its acceleration is   ac = v2 /R. The
direction of ac is always towards the centre of the circle.
The angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity
v by   v = ωR.  The acceleration is ac = ω2R.
If T is the time period of revolution of the object in circular motion and ν is its
frequency, we have ω= 2π ν, v = 2πνR,  ac = 4π2ν2R

POINTS TO PONDER
1.The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as
the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the
path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are
equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all
other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.
2.In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the
path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.
3.The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,
you can always resolve them along any two independent axes.
4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform
circular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its
direction is changing.
5. An object subjected to two velocities v1 and v2 has a resultant velocity v = v1 + v2. Take
care to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v12= v1 − v2.
Here v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.
6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if
the speed is constant.
7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration
alone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial
velocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration
due to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.
