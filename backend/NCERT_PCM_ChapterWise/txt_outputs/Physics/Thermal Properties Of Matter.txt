CHAPTER  TEN
THERMAL  PROPERTIES  OF MATTER
10.1  INTRODUCTION
We all have common sense notions of heat and temperatur e.
Temperatur e is a measur e of ‘hotness’ of a body. A kettle
with boiling water is hotter than a box containing ice. In
physics, we need to define the notion of heat, temperatur e,
etc., mor e carefully. In this chapter , you will lear n what heat
is and how it is measured, and study the various pr oceses by
which heat flows fr om one body to another . Along the way,
you will find out why blacksmiths heat the ir on ring befor e
fitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a horse cart and why
the wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun
goes down. Y ou will also lear n what happens when water boils
or freezes, and its temperature does not change during these
processes even though a great deal of heat is flowing into or
out of it.
10.2  TEMPERATURE AND HEAT
We can begin studying ther mal pr operties of matter with
definitions of temperatur e and heat. T emperatur e is a r elative
measur e, or indication of hotness or coldness. A hot utensil
is said to have a high temperatur e, and ice cube to have a
low temperatur e. An object that has a higher temperatur e
than another object is said to be hotter . Note that hot and
cold ar
e relative ter ms, like tall and short. W e can perceive
temperature by touch. However , this temperatur e sense is
somewhat unr eliable and its range is too limited to be useful
for scientific purposes.
We know fr om experience that a glass of ice-cold water left
on a table on a hot summer day eventually war ms up wher eas
a cup of hot tea on the same table cools down. It means that
when the temperatur e of body, ice-cold water or hot tea in
this case, and its surr ounding medium ar e different, heat
transfer takes place between the system and the surr ounding
medium, until the body and the surr ounding medium ar e at
the same temperatur e. We also know that in the case of glass
tumbler of ice-cold water , heat flows fr om the envir onment to10.1 Introduction

the glass tumbler , wher eas in the case of hot
tea, it flows fr om the cup of hot tea to the
envir onment. So, we can say that heat is the
form of energy transferred between two (or
more) systems or a system and its
surroundings by virtue of temperature
difference.  The SI unit of heat ener gy
transferr ed is expr essed in joule (J) while SI unit
of temperature is Kelvin (K), and degree Celsius
(oC) is a commonly used unit of temperature.
When an object is heated, many changes may
take place. Its temperature may rise, it may
expand or change state. W e will study the ef fect
of heat on different bodies in later sections.
10.3  MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE
A measure of temperature is obtained using a
thermometer . Many physical pr operties of
materials change sufficiently with temperature.
Some such properties are used as the basis for
constructing thermometers. The commonly used
property is variation of the volume of a liquid
with temperature. For example, in common
liquid–in–glass thermometers,  mercury, alcohol
etc., are used whose volume varies linearly with
temperature over a wide range.
    Thermometers are calibrated so that a
numerical value may be assigned to a given
temperature in an appropr iate scale. For the
definition of any standard scale, two fixed
reference points are needed. Since all
substances change dimensions with
temperature, an absolute reference for
expansion is not available. However , the
necessary fixed points may be correlated to the
physical phenomena that always occur at the
same temperature. The ice point and the steam
point of water are two convenient fixed points
and are known as the freezing and boiling
points , respectively. These two points are the
temperatures at which pure water freezes and
boils under standard pressure. The two familiar
temperature scales are the Fahrenheit
temperature scale and the Celsius temperature
scale. The ice and steam point have values
32 °F and 212  °F, respectively, on the Fahr enheit
scale and 0 °C and 100 °C on the Celsius scale.
On the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal
intervals between two reference points, and on
the Celsius scale, there are 100.Fig. 10.1 A plot of Fah renheit temperature (tF) versus
Celsius temperatur e (tc).
 A relationship for converting between the two
scales may be obtained fr om a graph of
Fahr enheit temperatur e (tF) versus celsius
temperature (tC) in a straight line (Fig. 10.1),
whose equation is
t tF C – 32

10.4 IDEAL-GAS EQUATION AND
ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE
Liquid-in-glass thermometers show different
readings for temperatur es other than the fixed
points because of dif fering expansion pr operties.
A ther mometer that uses a gas, however , gives
the same r eadings r egardless of which gas is
used. Experiments show that all gases at low
densities exhibit same expansion behaviour . The
variables that describe the behaviour of a given
quantity (mass) of gas ar e pressur e, volume, and
temperature ( P, V, and T)(wher e T = t + 273.15;
t is the temperature in °C). When temperature
is held constant, the pr essur e and volume of a
quantity of gas ar e related as  PV
 = constant.
This r elationship is known as Boyle’s law, after
Robert Boyle (1627–1691), the English Chemist
who discover ed it. When the pr essur e is held
constant, the volume of a quantity of the gas is
related to the temperatur e as V/T = constant.
This relationship is known as Charles’ law,
after  French scientist Jacques Charles (1747–
1823). Low-density gases obey these
laws, which may be combined into a singleTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 203

named after the British scientist Lord Kelvin. On
this scale, – 273.15 °C is taken as the zero point,
that is 0 K (Fig. 10.4).
The size of unit in Kelvin and Celsius
temperature scales is the same.  So, temperature
on these scales are related by
T = tC + 273.15 (10.3)
10.5  THERMAL EXPANSION
You may have observed that sometimes sealed
bottles with metallic lids are so tightly screwed
that one has to put the lid in hot water for some
time to open it. This would allow the metallic lid
to expand, thereby loosening it to unscrew
easily. In case of liquids, you may have observed
that mercury in a thermometer rises, when the
thermometer is put in slightly war m water . If
we take out the thermometer from the warmFig. 10.2 Pressure versus temperature of a low
density gas kept at constant volume.Fig. 10.3 A plot of pressure versus temperature and
extrapolation of lines for low density gases

temperatur e.
Fig. 10.4 Comparision of the Kelvin, Celsius and
Fahrenheit temperatur e scales.relationship.  Notice that since PV = constant
and V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas,
then PV/T should also be a constant. This
relationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be
written in a more general form that applies not
just to a given quantity of a single gas but to any
quantity of any low-density gas and is known as
ideal-gas equation :
or PV = µRT (10.2)
where, µ is the number of moles in the sample of
gas and R is called universal gas constant:
R = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1
In Eq. 10.2, we have learnt that the pressure
and volume ar e dir ectly pr oportional to
temperature : PV ∝  T. This relationship allows a
gas to be used to measur e temperatur e in a
constant volume gas ther mometer . Holding the
volume of a gas constant, it gives P ∝T. Thus,
with a constant-volume gas ther mometer ,
temperature is r ead in ter ms of pr essur e. A plot
of pressur e versus temperatur e gives a straight
line in this case, as shown in Fig. 10.2.
However , measur ements on r eal gases deviate
from the values pr edicted by the ideal gas law
at low temperatur e. But the r elationship is linear
over a lar ge temperatur e range, and it looks as
though the pressur e might r each zer o with
decreasing temperatur e if the gas continued to
be a gas. The absolute minimum temperatur e
for an ideal gas, ther efore, inferr ed by
extrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in
Fig. 10.3.  This temperature is found to be
– 273.15 °C and is designated as absolute zero .

water the level of mercury falls again. Similarly,
in case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a
cool room may expand to full size when placed
in war m water . On the other hand, a fully
inflated balloon when immersed in cold water
would start shrinking due to contraction of the
air inside.
It is our common experience that most
substances expand on heating and contract on
cooling. A change in the temperatur e of a body
causes change in its dimensions. The incr ease
in the dimensions of a body due to the incr ease
in its temperature is called ther mal expansion.
The expansion in length is called linear
expansion . The expansion in ar ea is called area
expansion . The expansion in volume is called
volume expansion  (Fig. 10.5).
Fig. 10.5   Thermal Expansion.
If the substance is in the for m of a long r od,
then for small change in temperatur e, ∆T, the
fractional change in length, ∆l/l, is dir ectly
proportional to ∆T.

where α1 is known as the coefficient of linear
expansion (or linear expansivity) and is
characteristic of the material of the rod. In Table
10.1, typical average values of the coefficient of
linear expansion for some material in the
temperature range 0  °C to 100 °C are given. From
this Table, compare the value of αl for glass and
copper . We find that copper expands about five
times more than glass for the same rise in
temperature. Normally, metals expand more and
have relatively high values of αl.Table 10.1 Values of coefficient of linear

Similarly, we consider the fractional change
in volume, ∆V

expansion (or volume expansivity) ,   as

Here αV is also a characteristic of the
substance but is not strictly a constant. It
depends in general on temperature (Fig 10.6). It
is seen that αV becomes constant only at a high
temperature.

as a function of temperatur e.
Table 10.2 gives the values of coefficient of
volume expansion of some common substances
in the temperatur e range 0–100 °C. You can see

like pyrex glass and invar (a special iron-nickel
alloy) having particularly low values of αV. From
this Table we find that the value of αv for
alcohol (ethanol) is more than mercury and
expands more than mercury for the same rise

Water exhibits an anomalous behaviour; it
contracts on heating between 0  °C and 4  °C. The
volume of a given amount of water decreases as
it is cooled from room temperature, until its
temperature reaches 4 °C, [Fig. 10.7(a)]. Below
4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore, the
density decreases [Fig. 10.7(b)].
This means that water has the maximum
density at 4 °C. This property has an important
envir onmental ef fect: bodies of water , such aslakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake
cools toward 4  
°C, water near the surface loses
energy to the atmosphere, becomes denser , and
sinks; the war mer, less dense water near the
bottom rises. However , once the colder water on
top reaches temperature below 4  °C, it becomes
less dense and remains at the surface, where it
freezes. If water did not have this property, lakes
and ponds would freeze from the bottom up,
which would destroy much of their animal and
plant life.
Gases, at ordinary temperature, expand more
than solids and liquids. For liquids, the
coefficient of volume expansion is r elatively
independent of the temperatur e. However , for
gases it is dependent on temperatur e. For an
ideal gas, the coef ficient of volume expansion at
constant pr essur e can be found fr om the ideal
gas equation:

At 0  °C, αv = 3.7  × 10–3 K–1, which is much
larger than that for solids and liquids.
Equation (10.6) shows the temp erature
dependence of  αv; it decreases with increasing
temperature. For a gas at room temperature and
constant pressure, αv is about 3300  × 10–6 K–1, as

coefficient of volume expansion of typical liquids.
There is a simple relation between the
coefficient of volume expansion ( αv) and
coefficient of linear expansion ( αl). Imagine a
cube of length, l, that expands equally in all
directions, when its temperatur e incr eases by
∆T. We have
∆l = αl l ∆T
so, ∆V = (l+∆l)3 – l3 ≃ 3l2 ∆l (10.7)

What happens by preventing the thermal
expansion of a r od by fixing its ends rigidly?
Clearly, the r od acquires a compr essive strain
due to the exter nal forces provided by the rigid
support at the ends. The corr esponding str ess
set up in the r od is called thermal stress . For
example, consider a steel rail of length 5 m and
area of cross-section 40 cm2 that is prevented
from expanding while the temperature rises by
10 °C. The coefficient of linear expansion of steel
is αl(steel) = 1.2  × 10–5  K–1. Thus, the compressive
strain is ∆l
l= αl(steel) ∆T = 1.2  × 10–5 × 10=1.2  × 10–4.
Youngs modulus of steel is Y (steel) = 2 × 1011 N m–2.
Therefore, the thermal stress developed is

in comparision with 2 and may be neglected.

10.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY
Take some water in a vessel and start heating it
on a bur ner. Soon you will notice that bubbles
begin to move upward. As the temperature is
raised the motion of water particles increases
till it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling.
What are the factors on which the quantity of
heat required to raise the temperature of a
substance depend? In order to answer this
question in the first step, heat a given quantity
of water to raise its temperature by, say 20 °C
and note the time taken. Again take the same
amount of water and raise its temperature by
40 °C using the same source of heat. Note the
time taken by using a stopwatch. Y ou will find it
takes about twice the time and therefore, double
the quantity of heat required raising twice the
temperature of same amount of water .
In the second step, now suppose you take
double the amount of water and heat it, using
the same heating arrangement, to raise the
temperature by 20  °C, you will find the time taken
is again twice that required in the first step.
In the thir d step, in place of water , now heat
the same quantity of some oil, say mustard oil,
and raise the temperature again by 20  °C. Now
note the time by the same stopwatch. Y ou will
find the time taken will be shorter and therefore,
the quantity of heat required would be less than
that required by the same amount of water for
the same rise in temperature.
The above observations show that the quantity
of heat r equir ed to war m a given substance
depends on its mass, m, the change in
temperatur e, ∆T and the natur e of substance.
The change in temperatur e of a substance , when
a given quantity of heat is absorbed or r ejected
by it, is characterised by a quantity called the
heat capacity  of that substance. W e define heat
capacity, S of a substance as
QST∆=∆(10.10)
where ∆Q is the amount of heat supplied to
the substance to change its temperatur e from T
to T + ∆T.
You have observed that if equal amount of
heat is added to equal masses of dif ferent
substances, the r esulting temperatur e changes
will not be the same. It implies that every
substance has a unique value for the amount ofheat absorbed or given off to change the
temperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This
quantity is referred to as the specific heat
capacity  of the substance.
If ∆Q stands for the amount of heat absorbed
or given off by a substance of mass m when it
undergoes a temperature change ∆T, then the
specific heat capacity, of that substance is given
by
1S Qsm m T∆= =∆(10.11)
The specific heat capacity  is the property of
the substance which determines the change in
the temperature of the substance (undergoing
no phase change) when a given quantity of heat
is absorbed (or given off) by it. It is defined as the
amount of heat per unit mass absorbed or given
off by the substance to change its temperature
by one unit. It depends on the nature of the
substance and its temperature. The SI unit of
specific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.
If the amount of substance is specified in
terms of moles µ, instead of mass m in kg, we
can define heat capacity per mole of the
substance by
(10.12)
where C is known as molar specific heat
capacity  of the substance. Like S, C also
depends on the natur e of the substance and its
temperature. The SI unit of molar specific heat
capacity is J mol–1 K–1.
However , in connection with specific heat
capacity of gases, additional conditions may be
needed to define C. In this case, heat transfer
can be achieved by keeping either pr essur e or
volume constant. If the gas is held under
constant pr essur e during the heat transfer , then
it is called the molar specific heat capacity at
constant pressure  and is denoted by Cp. On
the other hand, if the volume of the gas is
maintained during the heat transfer , then the
corresponding molar specific heat capacity is
called molar specific heat capacity at constant
volume  and is denoted by Cv. For details see
Chapter 11. Table 10.3 lists measured specific
heat capacity of some substances at atmospheric
pressure and ordinary temperature while Table
10.4 lists molar specific heat capacities of some
gases. From Table 10.3 you can note that water
Reprint 2025-26
THERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 209⊳has the highest specific heat capacity compared
to other substances. For this reason water is also
used as a coolant in automobile radiators, as
well as, a heater in hot water bags. Owing to its
high specific heat capacity, water warms up
more slowly than land during summer , and
consequently wind from the sea has a cooling
effect. Now, you can tell why in desert ar eas,
the earth sur face war ms up quickly during the
day and cools quickly at night.

10.7  CALORIMETRY
A system is said to be isolated if no exchange or
transfer of heat occurs between the system and
its surr oundings. When dif ferent parts of an
isolated system ar e at dif ferent temperature, a
quantity of heat transfers fr om the part at higher
temperatur e to the part at lower temperatur e.
The heat lost by the part at higher temperatur e
is equal to the heat gained by the part at lower
temperatur e.
Calorimetry means measur ement of heat.
When a body at higher temperatur e is br
ought
in contact with another body at lower
temperature, the heat lost by the hot body isequal to the heat gained by the colder body,
provided no heat is allowed to escape to the
surroundings. A device in which heat
measurement can be done is called a
calorimeter . It consists of a metallic vessel and
stirrer of the same material, like copper or
aluminium. The vessel is kept inside a wooden
jacket, which contains heat insulating material,
like glass wool etc. The outer jacket acts as a
heat shield and reduces the heat loss from the
inner vessel. There is an opening in the outer
jacket through which a mercury thermometer
can be inserted into the calorimeter (Fig. 10.20).
The following example provides a method by
which the specific heat capacity of a given solid
can be determinated by using the principle, heat
gained is equal to the heat lost.
Example 10.3  A sphere of 0.047 kg
aluminium is placed for sufficient time in a
vessel containing boiling water , so that the
sphere is at 100 °C. It is then immediately
transfer ed to 0.14 kg copper calorimeter
containing 0.25 kg water at 20  °C. The
temperature of water rises and attains a
steady state at 23 °C. Calculate the specific
heat capacity of aluminium.
Answer   In solving this example, we shall use
the fact that at a steady  state, heat given by an
aluminium sphere will be equal to the heat
absorbed by the water and calorimeter .
Mass of aluminium sphere ( m1) = 0.047 kg

Change in temperature  (∆T)=(100 °C-23 °C)= 77 °C

10.8  CHANGE OF STATE
Matter normally exists in three states: solid,
liquid and gas. A transition from one of these
states to another is called a change of state. Two
common changes of states ar e solid to liquid
and liquid to gas (and, vice versa). These changes
can occur when the exchange of heat takes place
between the substance and its surr oundings.
To study the change of state on heating or
cooling, let us per form the following activity.
Take some cubes of ice in a beaker . Note the
temperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a
constant heat source. Note the temperature after
every  minute.  Continuously stir the mixture of
water and ice. Draw a graph between
temperatur e and time (Fig. 10.9). Y ou will observe
no change in the temperature as long as there
is ice in the beaker . In the above pr ocess, the
temperature of the system does not change even
though heat is being continuously supplied. The
heat supplied  is being utilised in changing the
state from solid (ice) to liquid (water).Fig. 10.9 A plot of temperature versus time showing
the changes in the state of ice on heating
(not to scale).
The change of state from solid to liquid is called
melting  or fusion and from liquid to solid is called
freezing . It is observed that the temperature
remains constant until the entire amount of the
solid substance melts. That is, both the solid and
the liquid states of the substance coexist in
thermal equilibrium during the change of
states from solid to liquid.  The temperature at
which the solid and the liquid states of the
substance is in thermal equilibrium with each
other is called its melting point . It is
characteristic of the substance. It also depends
on pressure. The melting point of a substance
at standard atomspheric pressure is called its
normal melting point . Let us do the following
activity to understand the process of melting
of ice.
Take a slab of ice. T ake a metallic wir e and
fix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends. Put
the wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 10.10.
You will observe that the wir e passes thr ough
the ice slab. This happens due to the fact that
just below the wir e, ice melts at lower
temperature due to incr ease in pr essur e. When
the wir e has passed, water above the wir e freezes
again. Thus, the wire passes through the slab
and the slab does not split. This phenomenon
of refreezing is called regelation . Skating is
possible on snow due to the formation of water
under the skates. W ater is for med due to the
increase of pressure and it acts as a
lubricant.

After the whole of ice gets converted into water
and as we continue further heating, we shall see
that temperature begins to rise (Fig.10.9). The
temperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly100 °C when it again becomes steady. The heat
supplied is now being utilised to change water
from liquid state to vapour or  gaseous state.
The change of state from liquid to vapour (or
gas) is called vaporisation . It is observed that
the temperatur e remains constant until the
entire amount of the liquid is converted into
vapour . That is, both the liquid and vapour states
of the substance coexist in ther mal equilibrium,
during the change of state fr om liquid to vapour .
The temperatur e at which the liquid and the
vapour states of the substance coexist is called
its boiling point . Let us do the following activity
to understand the pr ocess of boiling of water .
Take a r ound-bottom flask, mor e than half
filled with water . Keep it over a bur ner and fix a
Triple Point
The temperatur e of a substance r emains constant during its change of state (phase change).
A graph between the temperatur e T and the Pr essur e P of the substance is called a phase
diagram or P – T diagram. The following figur e shows the phase diagram of water and CO2.
Such a phase diagram divides the P – T plane into a solid-r egion, the vapour -region and the
liquid-r egion. The r egions ar e separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion
curve (AO) and vaporisation curve  (CO). The points on sublimation curve  represent states
in which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO r epresent
states in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO r epresent
states in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO r epresent
states in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperatur e and pr essur e at which
the fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the thr ee
phases of  a substance coexist is called the triple point  of the substance. For example the
triple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.1 1×10–3 Pa.

thermometer and steam outlet through the cork
of the flask (Fig. 10.11). As water gets heated in
the flask, note first that the air , which was
dissolved in the water , will come out as small
bubbles. Later , bubbles of steam will for m at
the bottom but as they rise to the cooler water
near the top, they condense and disappear .
Finally, as the temperatur e of the entir e mass
of the water reaches 100  °C, bubbles of steam
reach the sur face and boiling is said to occur .
The steam in the flask may not be visible but as
it comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny
droplets of water , giving a foggy appearance.
Fig. 10.11  Boiling process.
If now the steam outlet is closed for a few
seconds to incr ease the pr essur e in the flask,
you will notice that boiling stops. Mor e heat
would be r equired to raise the temperatur e
(depending on the incr ease in pressur e) before
boiling begins again. Thus boiling point incr eases
with increase in pr essur e.
Let us now remove the bur ner. Allow water to
cool to about 80  °C. Remove the thermometer and
steam outlet. Close the flask with the airtightcork. Keep the flask turned upside down on the
stand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. W ater
vapours in the flask condense r educing the
pressur e on the water sur face inside the flask.
Water begins to boil again, now at a lower
temperature. Thus boiling point decr eases with
decrease in pr essur e.
This explains why cooking is difficult on hills.
At high altitudes, atmospheric pr essur e is lower ,
reducing the boiling point of water as compar ed
to that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling
point is incr eased inside a pr essur e cooker by
increasing the pr essur e. Hence cooking is faster .
The boiling point of a substance at standar d
atmospheric pr essur e is called its normal
boiling point.
However , all substances do not pass thr ough
the thr ee states: solid-liquid-gas. Ther e are
certain substances which nor mally pass fr om
the solid to the vapour state dir ectly and vice
versa. The change fr om solid state to vapour
state without passing thr ough the liquid state
is called sublimation , and the substance is said
to sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also
iodine. During the sublimation pr ocess both the
solid and vapour states of a substance coexist
in thermal equilibrium.
10.8.1  Latent Heat
In Section 10.8, we have learnt that certain
amount of heat ener gy is transferred between a
substance and its surr oundings when it
under goes a change of state. The amount of heat
per unit mass transferr ed during change of state
of the substance is called latent heat of the
substance for the pr ocess. For example, if heat
is added to a given quantity of ice at –10  °C, the
temperature of ice incr eases until it r eaches its
melting point (0  °C). At this temperature, the
addition of mor e heat does not incr ease the
temperatur e but causes the ice to melt, or
changes its state. Once the entir e ice melts,
adding mor e heat will cause the temperatur e of
the water to rise. A similar situation
occurs during liquid gas change of state at the
boiling point. Adding mor e heat to boiling water
causes vaporisation, without increase in
temperature.
Reprint 2025-26
THERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 213⊳The heat required during a change of state
depends upon the heat of transformation and
the mass of the substance under going a change
of state. Thus, if mass m of a substance
under goes a change fr om one state to the other ,
then the quantity of heat r equir ed is given by
Q = m L
orL = Q/m (10.13)
where L is known as latent heat and is a
characteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is
J kg–1. The value of L also depends on the
pressur e. Its value is usually quoted at standar d
atmospheric pr essur e. The latent heat for a solid-
liquid state change is called the latent heat of
fusion  (Lf), and that for a liquid-gas state change
is called the latent heat of vaporisation  (Lv).
These ar e often r eferred to as the heat of fusion
and the heat of vaporisation. A plot of
temperature versus heat  for a quantity of water
is shown in Fig. 10.12. The latent heats of some
substances, their freezing and boiling points, are
given in Table 10.5.
Fig. 10.12 Temperature versus heat for water at
1 atm pr essur e (not to scale).Note that when heat is added (or removed)
during a change of state, the temperature
remains constant. Note in Fig. 10.12 that the
slopes of the phase lines ar e not all the same,
which indicate that specific heats of the various
states ar e not equal. For water , the latent heat of
fusion and vapori sation are Lf = 3.33  × 105 J kg–1
and Lv = 22.6 × 105 J kg–1, respectively. That is,
3.33  × 105 J of heat is needed to melt 1 kg ice at
0 °C, and 22.6  × 105 J of heat is needed to convert
1 kg  water into steam at 100 °C. So, steam at
100 °C carries  22.6  × 105 J  kg–1 more heat than
water at 100 °C. This is why burns from steam
are usually more serious than those from
boiling water .

10.9  HEAT TRANSFER
We have seen that heat is ener gy transfer
from one system to another or from one part
of a system to another part, arising due totemperature difference. What are the different
ways by which this energy transfer takes
place? There are three distinct modes of heat
transfer: conduction, convection and radiation
(Fig. 10.13).
Fig. 10.13 Heating by conduction, convection and
radiation.
10.9.1  Conduction
Conduction is the mechanism of transfer of heat
between two adjacent parts of a body because
of their temperature difference. Suppose, one end
of a metallic r od is put in a flame, the other end
of the r od will soon be so hot that you cannot
hold it by your bare hands. Here, heat transfer
takes place by conduction fr om the hot end of
the rod thr ough its dif ferent parts to the other
end.  Gases are poor thermal conductors, while
liquids have conductivities inter mediate between
solids and gases.
Heat conduction may be described
quantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a
material for a given temperatur e difference.
Consider a metallic bar of length L and uniform
cross -section A with its two ends maintained at
different temperatures. This can be done, for
example, by putting the ends in ther mal contact
with large reservoirs at temperatures , say, TC and
TD, respectively (Fig. 1 0.14). Let us assume the
ideal condition that the sides of the bar ar e fully
insulated so that no heat is exchanged between
the sides and the surr ounding s.
After sometime, a steady state is reached; the
temperatur e of the bar decr eases unifor mly with
distance fr om TC to TD; (TC>TD). The r eservoir at
C supplies heat at a constant rate, which
transfers through the bar and is given out at
the same rate to the reservoir at D. It is found
Reprint 2025-26
THERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 215⊳experimentally that in this steady state, the rate
of flow of heat (or heat current) H is proportional
to the temperature difference ( TC – TD) and the
area of cross-section A and is inversely
proportional to the length L :
H = KA –C DT T
L(10.14)
The constant of proportionality K is called the
thermal conductivity  of the material. The
greater the value of K for a material, the mor e
rapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of K
 is
J s–1 m–1 K–1 or W m–1 K–1. The thermal
conductivities of various substances ar e listed
in Table 10.6. These values vary slightly with
temperatur e, but can be consider ed to be
constant over a nor mal temperatur e range.
Compar e the r elatively lar ge ther mal
conductivities of  good thermal conductors and,
metals, with the relatively small thermal
conductivities of some good ther mal insulators,
such as wood and glass wool. Y ou may have
noticed that some cooking pots have copper
coating on the bottom. Being a good conductor
of heat, copper pr omotes the distribution of heat
over the bottom of a pot for unifor m cooking.
Plastic foams, on the other hand, ar e good
insulators, mainly because they contain pockets
of air . Recall that gases ar e poor conductors,
and note the low ther mal conductivity of air in
the Table 10.5. Heat retention and transfer are
important in many other applications. Houses
made of concr ete r oofs get very hot during
summer days because thermal conductivity of
concr ete (though much smaller than that of a
metal) is still not small enough. Therefore, people,
usually, prefer to give a layer of earth or foam
insulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer isprohibited and keeps the r oom cooler . In some
situations, heat transfer is critical. In a nuclear
reactor , for example, elaborate heat transfer
systems need to be installed so that the
enormous ener gy pr oduced by nuclear fission
in the core transits out suf ficiently fast, thus
preventing the cor e from over heating.

Answer   The insulating material around the rods
reduces heat loss from the sides of the rods.
Therefore, heat flows only along the length of
the rods. Consider any cr oss section of the r od.
In the steady state, heat flowing into the element
must equal the heat flowing out of it; otherwise
there would be a net gain or loss of heat by the
element and its temperatur e would not be
steady. Thus in the steady state, rate of heat
flowing acr oss a cr oss section of the r od is the
same at every point along the length of the
combined steel-copper r od. Let T be the

10.9.2  Convection
Convection is a mode of heat transfer by actual
motion of matter . It is  possible only in fluids.
Convection can be natural or for ced. In natural
convection, gravity plays an important part.
When a fluid is heated fr om below, the hot part
expands and, ther efore, becomes less dense.
Because of buoyancy, it rises and the upper
colder part r eplaces it. This again gets heated,
rises up and is replaced by the relatively colder
part of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode
of heat transfer is evidently different from
conduction. Convection involves bulk transport
of different parts of the fluid.
     In forced convection, material is forced to move
by a pump or by some other physical means. The
common  examples of forced convection systems
are forced-air heating systems in home, the
human circulatory system, and the cooling
system of an automobile engine. In the human
body, the heart acts as the pump that circulates
blood through different parts of the body,
transferring heat by forced convection and
maintaining it at a uniform temperature.
Natural convection is responsible for many
familiar phenomena. During the day, the
ground heats up more quickly than large bodiesof water do . This occurs both because water has
a greater specific heat capacity and because
mixing currents disperse the absorbed heat
throughout the gr eat volume of water . The air
in contact with the warm ground is heated by
conduction. It expands, becoming less dense
than the surr ounding cooler air . As a r esult, the
warm air rises (air currents) and the other air
moves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea
breeze near a lar ge body of water . Cooler air
descends, and a thermal convection cycle is set
up, which transfers heat away from the land.
At night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,
and the water surface is warmer than the land.
As a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 10.17).
The other example of natural convection is
the steady sur face wind on the earth blowing
in from north-east towar ds the equator , the
so-called trade wind. A resonable explanation
is as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of
the earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the
earth’s surface near the equator is hot, while
the air in the upper atmospher e of the poles is
cool. In the absence of any other factor , a
convection curr ent would be set up, with the
air at the equatorial sur face rising and moving
out towar ds the poles, descending and
streaming in towar ds the equator . The r otation
of the earth, however , modifies this convection
current. Because of this, air close to the equator
has an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it
is zer o close to the poles. As a r esult, the air
descends not at the poles but at 30° N (North)
latitude and r eturns to the equator . This is
called trade wind .

10.9.3  Radiation
Conduction and convection require some
material as a transport medium. These modes
of heat transfer cannot operate between bodies
separated by a distance in vacuum. But the
earth does receive heat from the Sun across a
huge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the
warmth of the fire nearby even though air
conducts poorly and before convection takes
some time to set in. The third mechanism for
heat transfer needs no medium; it is called
radiation and the energy so transferred by
electromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.
In an electromagnetic wave, electric and
magnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like
any wave, electromagnetic waves can have
different wavelengths and can travel in vacuum
with the same speed, namely the speed of light
i.e., 3 × 108 m s–1 . You will lear n these matters in
more detail later , but you now know why heat
transfer by radiation does not need any medium
and why it is so fast. This is how heat is
transferred to the earth from the Sun through
empty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,
whether they are solid, liquid or gas. The
electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by
virtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red
hot iron or light from a filament lamp is called
thermal radiation.
When this ther mal radiation falls on other
bodies, it is partly r eflected and partly absorbed.
The amount of heat that a body can absorb by
radiation depends on the colour of the body.
We find that black bodies absorb and emit
radiant energy better than  bodies of lighter
colours. This fact finds many applications in our
daily life. W e wear white or light colour ed clothes
in summer , so that they absorb the least heat
from the Sun. However , during winter , we use
dark coloured clothes , which absorb heat from
the sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of
utensils for cooking food are blackened so that
they absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer
it to the vegetables to be cooked.
Similarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is
a device to minimise heat transfer between the
contents of the bottle and outside. It consists
of a double-walled glass vessel with the inner
and outer walls coated with silver . Radiation
from the inner wall is reflected back to thecontents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly
reflects back any incoming radiation. The space
between the walls is evacuted to r educe
conduction and convection losses and the flask
is supported on an insulator , like cork. The
device is, ther efore, useful for pr eventing hot
contents (like, milk) from getting cold, or
alternatively, to store cold contents (like, ice).
10.9.4 Blackbody Radiation
We have so far not mentioned the wavelength
content of thermal radiation. The important
thing about thermal radiation at any
temperature is that it is not of one (or a few)
wavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum
from the small to the long wavelengths. The
energy content of radiation, however , varies for
different wavelengths. Figure 10.18 gives the
experimental curves for radiation energy per unit
area per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody
versus wavelength for different temperatures.
Fig. 10.18:   Energy emitted versus wavelength
for a blackbody at different
temperatures
Notice that the wavelength λm for which energy
is the maximum decreases with increasing
temperature. The relation between λm and T is
given by what is known as Wien’s Displacement
Law:
λm T  =  constant (10.15)
The value of the constant (Wien’s constant)
is 2.9 × 10–3 m K. This law explains why the
colour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame
first becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and
finally white hot. Wien’s law is useful for
estimating the surface temperatures of celestial

intensity near the wavelength 14 µm. By Wien’s
law, the surface of the moon is estimated to have
a temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a
maximum at λm = 4753 Å. This corresponds to
T = 6060 K. Remember , this is the temperatur e
of the sur face of the sun, not its interior .
The most significant feature of the
blackbody radiation curves in Fig. 10.18  is that
they are universal . They depend only on the
temperature and not on the size, shape or
material of the blackbody. Attempts to explain
blackbody radiation theoretically, at the
beginning of the twentieth century, spurred the
quantum revolution in physics, as you will
learn in later courses.
Energy can be transferred by radiation over
large distances, without a medium (i.e. , in
vacuum). The total electromagnetic energy
radiated by a body at absolute temperature T
is proportional to its size, its ability to radiate
(called emissivity)  and most importantly to its
temperature. For a body , which is a perfect
radiator , the ener gy emitted per unit time ( H)
is given by
H = AσT4(10.16)
where A is the area and T is the absolute
temperature of the body.  This relation obtained
experimentally by Stefan and later proved
theoretically by Boltzmann is known as Stefan-
Boltzmann law  and the constant σ is called
Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units
is 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4. Most bodies emit only a
fraction of the rate given by Eq. 10.16 . A substance
like lamp black comes close to the limit. One,
therefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e
called emissivity  and writes,
H = AeσT4(10.17)
Here, e = 1 for a per fect radiator . For a tungsten
lamp, for example, e is about 0.4. Thus , a tungsten
lamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface
area of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate  H = 0.3 ×
10–4 × 0.4 × 5.67 × 10–8 × (3000)4 = 60 W .
A body at temperature T, with surroundings
at temperatures Ts, emits, as well as, receives
energy. For a per fect radiator , the net rate of
loss of radiant energy is
H = σA (T4 – Ts4)For a body with emissivity e, the relation
modifies to
H = eσ A (T4 – Ts4) (10.18)
As an example, let us estimate the heat
radiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area
of a person’s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room
temperature is 22 °C. The internal body
temperature, as we know, is about 37  °°C.  The
skin temperature may be 28° °C (say). The
emissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the
relevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The
rate of heat loss is:
H = 5.67 × 10–8 × 1.9 × 0.97 × {(301)4 – (295)4}
 =66.4 W
which is more than half the rate of energy
production by the body at rest (120 W). To
prevent this heat loss effectively (better than
ordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has
an additional thin shiny metallic layer next to
the skin, which reflects the body’s radiation.
10.10  NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING
We all know that hot water or milk when left on
a table begins to cool, gradually. Ultimately it
attains the temperature of the surroundings. To
study how slow or fast a given body can cool on
exchanging heat with its surroundings, let us
perform the following activity.
Take some water , say 300 mL, in a
calorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a
two-holed lid. Fix the stirrer through one hole
and fix a thermometer through another hole
in the lid and make sure that the bulb of
thermometer is immersed in the water . Note
the r eading of the ther mometer . This r eading
T1 is the temperature of the surroundings.
Heat the water kept in the calorimeter till it
attains a temperature, say 40  °C above room
temperature (i.e., temperature of the
surroundings). Then, stop heating the water
by removing the heat source. Start the
stop-watch and note the reading of the
thermometer after a fixed interval of time, say
after every one minute of stirring gently with
the stirr er. Continue to note the temperatur e
(T2) of water till it attains a temperature about
5 °C above that of the surroundings. Then, plot
Reprint 2025-26
220 PHYSICS
a graph by taking each value of temperature
∆T = T2 – T1 along y-axis and the coresponding
value of  t along x-axis (Fig. 10.19).
Fig. 10.19 Curve showing cooling of hot water
with time.
From the graph you can infer how the cooling
of hot water depends on the difference of its
temperatur e from that of the surr oundings. Y ou
will also notice that initially the rate of cooling
is higher and decreases as the temperature of
the body falls.
The above activity shows that a hot body loses
heat to its surroundings in the form of heat
radiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on
the difference in temperature between the body
and its surroundings. Newton was the first to
study, in a systematic manner , the r elation
between the heat lost by a body in a given
enclosure and its temperature.
According to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate
of loss of heat, – d Q/dt of the body is directly
proportional to the difference of temperature
∆T = (T2–T1) of the body and the surr oundings.
The law holds good only for small dif ference of
temperatur e. Also, the loss of  heat by radiation
depends upon the natur e of the sur face of the
body and the ar ea of the exposed sur face. W e
can write
– (10.19)
where k is a positive constant depending upon
the ar ea and natur e of the sur face of the body.
Suppose a body of mass m and specific heat
capacity s is at temperatur e T2. Let T1 be the
temperatur e of the surr oundings. If the
temperature falls by a small amount d T2 in time
dt, then the amount of heat lost is
dQ = 
ms dT2
∴ Rate of loss of heat is given by

On integrating,
loge (T2 – T1) = – K t + c (10.22)
or T2 = T1 + C′ e–Kt; where C′ = ec(10.23)
Equation (10.23) enables you to calculate the
time of cooling of a body through a particular
range of temperature.
For small temperature differences, the rate
of cooling, due to conduction, convection, and
radiation combined, is proportional to the
difference in temperature. It is a valid
approximation in the transfer of heat from a
radiator to a room, the loss of heat through the
wall of a room, or the cooling of a cup of tea on
the table.

Newton’s law of cooling can be verified with
the help of the experimental set-up shown in
Fig. 10.20(a). The set-up consists of a double-
walled vessel (V) containing water  between
the two walls. A copper calorimeter (C)
containing hot water is placed inside the
double-walled vessel. Two thermometers
through the corks are used to note the
temperatures T2 of water in calorimeter and
T1 of hot water in between the double walls,
respectively. Temperature of hot water in the
calorimeter is noted after equal intervals of
time. A graph is plotted between lo ge (T2–T1)
[or ln(T2–T1)] and time ( t). The nature of the∆

SUMMARY
1.Heat is a form of energy that flows between a body and its surrounding medium by
virtue of temperatur e difference between them. The degr ee of hotness of the body is
quantitatively r epresented by temperatur e.
2.A temperatur e-measuring device (ther mometer) makes use of some measurable pr operty
(called ther mometric pr operty) that changes with temperatur e. Dif ferent ther mometers
lead to dif ferent temperatur e scales. T o construct a temperatur e scale, two fixed points
are chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperatur e. The two numbers fix
the origin of the scale and the size of its unit.
3.The Celsius temperatur e (tC) and the Far enheit temperar e (tF)are related by
tF = (9/5) tC + 32
4.The ideal gas equation connecting pressure ( P), volume ( V) and absolute temperature ( T)
is :
PV = µRT
where µ is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.
5.In the absolute temperature scale, the zero of the scale  corresponds to the temperature
where every substance in nature has the least possible molecular activity. The Kelvin
absolute temperature scale ( T ) has the same unit size as the Celsius scale ( Tc ), but
differs in the origin :
TC   =  T – 273.15
6.The coef ficient of linear expansion ( αl) and volume expansion ( αv) are defined by the
relations :
llTlα∆= ∆
VVTVα∆= ∆( )°°8 C= 70 C2 minK
The average of 69 °C and 71  °C is 70  °C, which
is 50 °C above room temperature. K is the same
for this situation as for the original.

Time = K (50 °C)

where ∆l  and  ∆V denote the change in length l and volume V for a change of temperature
∆T.  The r elation between them is :
αv  =  3 αl
7.The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by
smQ
T=1∆
∆
where m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its
temperatur e by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by
1QCTµ∆=∆
wher e µ is the number  of moles of the substance.
8.The latent heat of fusion ( Lf) is the heat per unit mass r equir ed to change a substance
from solid into liquid at the same temperatur e and pressur e. The latent heat of
vaporisation ( Lv) is the heat per unit mass r equir ed to change a substance fr om liquid
to the vapour state without change in the temperatur e and pr essur e.
9.The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.
10.In conduction, heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through
molecular collisions, without any flow of matter .  For a bar of length L and unifor m
cross section A with its ends maintained at temperatur es TC and TD, the rate of flow of
heat H is :
 C D T T
H = K AL−
wher e K is the ther mal conductivity of the material of the bar .
11.Newton’s Law of Cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the
excess temperature of the body over the surroundings :
2 1d( )dQ = – k T  – T    t
Where T1 is the temperature of the surrounding medium and T2 is the temperature of
the body.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.The relation connecting Kelvin temperature ( T) and the Celsius temperature tc
T  =  tc + 273.15
and the assignment T = 273.16 K for the triple point of water are exact relations (by
choice). W ith this choice, the Celsius temperatur e of the melting point of water and
boiling point of water (both at 1 atm pr essur e) are very close to, but not exactly equal
to 0  °C and 100 °C respectively.  In the original Celsius scale, these latter fixed points
were exactly at 0  °C and 100  °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the
preferred choice for the fixed point, because it has a unique temperatur e.
2.A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pr essur e and temperatur e throughout
the system; the two phases in equilibrium dif fer in their molar volume (i.e. density).
This is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium.
3.Heat transfer always involves temperatur e difference between two systems or two parts
of the same system. Any ener gy transfer that does not involve temperatur e difference
in some way is not heat.
4.Convection involves flow of matter within a fluid  due to unequal temperatur es of its
parts. A hot bar placed under a running tap loses heat by conduction between the
surface of the bar and water and not by convection within water .

on this (Kelvin) scale ?
