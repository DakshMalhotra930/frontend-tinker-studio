7.1  I NTRODUCTION
We have so far consider ed dir ect curr ent (dc) sour ces and cir cuits with dc
sources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages
and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains
supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function
with time. Such a voltage is called alter nating voltage  (ac voltage) and
the curr ent driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating curr ent (ac
current) *. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.
This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power
companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main
reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages
can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by
means of transfor mers. Further , electrical ener gy can also be transmitted
economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which
are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we
tune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special
property of ac cir cuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter .Chapter Seven
ALTERNATING
CURRENT
*The phrases ac voltage  and ac current  are contradictory and redundant,
respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage  and alternating
current current . Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity
displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted
that we follow others in its use. Further , voltage  – another phrase commonly
used means potential difference between two points.

7.2  AC V OLTAGE  APPLIED TO A RESISTOR
Figure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε of
ac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuit
diagram is . We consider a source which produces
sinusoidally varying potential difference across its
terminals. Let this potential difference, also called ac
voltage, be given by
sinmv v t ω = (7.1)
where vm is the amplitude of the oscillating potential
difference and ω  is its angular frequency.
To find the value of current through the resistor, we
apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule ε( )t=∑ 0(refer to Section
3.12), to the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1 to get
= sinmv t i Rω
or   sinmvi tRω =
Since R  is a constant, we can write this equation as
sinmi i t ω= (7.2)
where the current amplitude im is given by
m
mviR= (7.3)
Equation (7.3) is Ohm’s law, which for resistors, works equally
well for both ac and dc voltages. The voltage across a pure resistor
and the current through it, given by Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2) are
plotted as a function of time in Fig. 7.2. Note, in particular that
both v and i reach zero, minimum and maximum values at the
same time. Clearly, the voltage  and current are in phase with
each other .
We see that, like the applied voltage, the current varies
sinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative values
during each cycle. Thus, the sum of the instantaneous current
values over one complete cycle is zero, and the average current
is zero. The fact that the average current is zero, however, doesFIGURE  7.1  AC voltage applied to a resistor.

introducing the concept of rms values. In terms of rms values, the equation
for power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits
are essentially the same as those for the dc case.
It is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. For
example, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak
voltage of
vm = 2 V =  (1.414)(220 V) = 311 V
In fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would
produce the same average power loss as the alternating current. Equation
(7.7) can also be written as

7.3REPRESENT ATION OF AC C URRENT  AND VOLTAGE
BY ROTATING VECTORS  — P HASORS
In the previous section, we learnt that the current through  a resistor is
in phase with the ac voltage. But this is not so in the case  of an inductor ,
a capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to show
phase relationship between voltage and current
in an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors .
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the
use of a phasor diagram. A phasor * is a vector
which rotates about the origin with angular
speed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical
components of phasors V and I represent the
sinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The
magnitudes of phasors V and I represent  the
amplitudes or the peak values vm and im of these
oscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the
voltage and current phasors and their
relationship at time t1 for the case of an ac source
connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of
voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., vm sinw t and im sinw t,
respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As
they rotate with frequency w, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.
From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I  for the case of a resistor are
in the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase
angle between the voltage and the current is zero.
7.4  AC V OLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR
Figur e 7.5 shows an ac sour ce connected to an inductor . Usually,
inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall
assume that this inductor has negligible resistance.
Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let
the voltage across the source be v = vm sinw t. Using
the Kirchhoff’s loop rule, ε( )t=∑ 0, and  since there
is no resistor in the circuit,

*Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating
vectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens
that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine
mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of
corresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors  that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a

Combining Eqs. (7.1) and (7.10), we have

Equation (7.11) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a
function of time, must be such that its slope d i/dt is a sinusoidally varying
quantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude
given by vm/L. To obtain the current, we integrate d i/dt with respect to
time:

and get,
cos( ) constantmvi tL= − ω +ω
The integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-
independent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically
about zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about
zero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current
exists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.

The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance

purely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the
current in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly
proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.
A comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the
current in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by p/2 or
one-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current
phasors in the present case at instant t1. The current phasor I is p/2

1847.5  AC V OLTAGE APPLIED  TO A CAPACITOR
Figure 7.7 shows an ac source e generating ac voltage v = vm sin wt
connected to a capacitor only, a purely capacitive ac circuit.
When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source
in a dc circuit, current will flow for the short time
requir ed to char ge the capacitor . As char ge
accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage
across them increases, opposing the current. That is,
a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the
current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully
charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.
When the capacitor is connected to an ac source,
as in Fig. 7.7, it limits or regulates the current, but
does not completely prevent the flow of charge. The
capacitor is alternately charged and discharged as
the current reverses each half cycle. Let q  be the
charge on the capacitor at any time t. The instantaneous voltage v across
the capacitor is
qvC= (7.15)
From the Kirchhoff’s loop rule, the voltage across the source and the
capacitor are equal,

amplitude of the current in a purely capacitive
circuit in the same way as the resistance limits
the current in a purely resistive circuit. But it
is inversely proportional to the frequency and
the capacitance.
A comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the
equation of source voltage, Eq . (7.1) shows that
the current is π/2 ahead of voltage.
Figure 7. 8(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t1. Here the current
phasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate
counterclockwise. Figure 7. 8(b) shows the variation of voltage and current
with time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than
the voltage by one-fourth of a period.

Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict
your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each
case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?
Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor
gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and
the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.
With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ ωC)
and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.
Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly
than before.

Solution  As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil
magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,
the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive
reactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the
applied ac voltage appears acr oss the inductor , leaving less voltage
across the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.

7.6.1  Phasor-diagram solution
From the cir cuit shown in Fig. 7.10, we see that the r esistor , inductor
and capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is
the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be
i = im sin(wt+f) (7.21)
where f is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and
the current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous
sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.
Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by
Eq. (7.21). Further , let VL, VR, VC, and V represent the voltage acr oss the
inductor , resistor , capacitor and the sour ce, respectively. Fr om pr evious
section, we know that VR is parallel to I, VC is p/2
behind I and VL is  p/2 ahead of I. VL, VR, VC and I
are shown in Fig. 7.11(a) with apppropriate phase-
relations.
The length of these phasors or the amplitude
of VR, VC and VL are:
vRm = im R, vCm = im XC, vLm = im XL(7.22)
The voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit can
be written as
vL + vR + vC = v (7.23)
The phasor relation whose vertical component
gives the above equation is
VL + VR + VC = V (7.24)
This relation is represented in Fig. 7.11(b). Since
VC  and VL are always along the same line and in
opposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor ( VC + VL)
which has a magnitude ½vCm – vLm½. Since V is represented as the
hypotenuse of a right-triangle whose sides are VR and ( VC + VL), the
pythagorean theorem gives:

gives the phase angle. With these, Eq. (7.21) is completely specified.
If XC > XL, f is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.
Consequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. If
XC < XL, f is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.
Consequently, the current in the circuit lags  the source voltage.
Figure 7.1 3 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with w t
for the case XC > XL.
Thus, we have obtained the amplitude
and phase of current for an LCR series circuit
using the technique of phasors. But this
method of analysing ac circuits suffers from
certain disadvantages. First, the phasor
diagram say nothing about the initial
condition. One can take any arbitrary value
of t (say, t1, as done throughout this chapter)
and draw different phasors which show the
relative angle between different phasors.
The solution so obtained is called the
steady-state solution . This is not a general
solution. Additionally, we do have a
transient solution  which exists even for
v = 0. The general solution is the sum of the
transient solution and the steady-state
solution. After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solution
die out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-state
solution.
7.6.2  Resonance
An interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenon
of resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems
that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency
is called the system’s natural frequency . If such a system is driven by an
energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the
amplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this
phenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequency
for swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on theFIGURE  7.12  Impedance

We see that the current amplitude is

case (i) is twice to that for case (ii).
Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in the
tuning  mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio accepts
signals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the
antenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit
can be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio
station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a
capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the
circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received.
When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of
the signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.
It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a
circuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the
voltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)
and the current amplitude is vm/R, the total source voltage appearing
across R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or
RC circuit.FIGURE  7.14 Variation of  im with w for two

The algebraic sum of the two voltages, VR and VC is 311.3 V which
is mor e than the sour ce voltage of 220 V . How to r esolve this
paradox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not
in the same phase. Therefore, they cannot be added  like ordinary

Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using the
Pythagorean theorem:

The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in
R.H.S. of Eq. (7.29). It is only the second term which is time-dependent.
Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative
half). Therefore,

cosV Iφ = [7.30(a)]
This can also be written as,
2cos P I Z φ = [7.30(b)]
So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and
current but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The
quantity cos φ is called the power factor . Let us discuss the following
cases:
Case (i) Case (i) Case (i) Case (i) Case (i) Resistive circuit : If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called
resistive . In that case  φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There  is maximum power dissipation.
Case (ii) Case (ii) Case (ii) Case (ii) Case (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit : If the circuit contains
only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between
voltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated
even though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes
referred to as wattless current .
Case (iii) Case (iii) Case (iii) Case (iii) Case (iii) LCR series circuit : In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is
given by Eq. (7.30) where φ = tan–1 (Xc – XL )/ R. So,  φ may be non-zero  in
a RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in
the resistor.
Case (iv) Case (iv)Case (iv) Case (iv)Case (iv)  Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit : At resonance
Xc – XL= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cos φ = 1 and P = I2Z = I2 R. That is,
maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.

low power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.

Solution SolutionSolution SolutionSolution  (a) We know that P = I V cos φ where cos φ is the power factor.
To supply a given power at a given voltage, if cos φ is small, we have to
increase current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss
(I2R) in transmission.
(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then
power factor cos φ =R/Z.
We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to

192how this can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. Ip
along the applied voltage V and Iq perpendicular to the applied
voltage. Iq as you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the wattless
component since corresponding to this component of current, there
is no power loss.  IP  is known as the power component because it is
in phase with the voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.
It’s clear fr om this analysis that if we want to impr ove power factor ,
we must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current Iq by an
equal leading wattless current I¢q. This can be done by connecting
a capacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that Iq and I¢q cancel
each other and P is ef fectively Ip V.

1947.8  T RANSFORMERS
For many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating
voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with
a device called transfor mer using the principle of mutual induction.
A transfor mer consists of two sets of coils, insulated fr om each other .
They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in
Fig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the
coils called the primary coil  has Np turns. The other coil is called the
secondary coil ; it has Ns turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil
and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transfor mer.
FIGURE  7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:
(a) two coils on top of each other , (b) two coils on separate limbs of the cor e.
When an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting
current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary
and induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of
turns in the secondary. W e consider an ideal transfor mer in which the
primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both
primary and secondary windings. Let f be the flux in each turn in the core
at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage vp is applied to it.
Then the induced emf or voltage es, in the secondary with  Ns turns is
d
ds s Ntφε= − (7.31)
The alternating flux f also induces an emf, called back emf in the
primary. This is
d
dp p Ntφε= − (7.32)
But ep = vp. If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite
since the  primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary is
an open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good
approximation
es = vs
Reprint 2025-26
195Alternating Current
where  vs is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.31) and
(7.32) can be written as
s sdv Nd tφ= − [7.31(a)]
p pdv Nd tφ= − [7.32(a)]
From Eqs. [7.31 (a)] and [7.32 (a)], we have
s s
p pv N
v N=(7.33)
Note that the above relation has been obtained using three
assumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the
same flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux
escapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.
If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),
the power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,
ipvp = isvs(7.34)
Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,
since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than
95%. Combining Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), we have
p s s
s p pi v N
i v N= =(7.35)
Since i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,
Eq. (7.35) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of
corresponding quantities.
Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.
We have:
VN
NVss
pp =

   and  IN
NIsp
sp =

 (7.36)
That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the
primary ( Ns > Np), the voltage is stepped up  (Vs > Vp). This type of
arrangement is called a step-up transfor mer. However , in this arrangement,
there is less current in the secondary than in the primary ( Np/Ns < 1 and Is
< Ip). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and
the secondary has 200 turns,  Ns/Np = 2 and Np/Ns=1/2. Thus, a 220V
input at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.
If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary ( Ns < Np),
we have a step-down transfor mer. In this case, Vs < Vp and Is > Ip. That
is, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current
is increased.
The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without
any energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do
occur due to the following reasons:
(i)Flux Leakage : There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of
the flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor

1.An alternating voltage sin= ωm v v t  applied to a resistor R drives a
current i = im sinwt in the r esistor , m
mviR= . The curr ent is in phase with
the applied voltage.
2.For an alternating current i  = im sin wt passing through a resistor R , the
average power loss P  (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is
(1/2)i2

special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)

3.An ac voltage v  = vm sin wt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current
in the inductor i = im sin ( wt – p/2), where im = vm/XL. XL = wL is called
inductive reactance . The current in the inductor lags the voltage by
p/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle
is zero.design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by
winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other .
(ii)Resistance of the windings : The wire used for the windings has some
resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire
(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by
using thick wire.
(iii)Eddy currents : The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents
in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a
laminated core.
(iv)Hysteresis : The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by
the alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in
the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic
material which has a low hysteresis loss.
The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over
long distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output
of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and
consequently, the I2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long
distances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage
is stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations
and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.

current is referred to as a wattless current .
7.The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit
can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by
rotating vectors called phasors . A phasor is a vector which rotates
about the origin with angular speed w. The magnitude of a phasor
represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or
current) r epresented by the phasor .
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor
diagram.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms
value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is
normally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude
of this voltage is
V 2 2(240) 340mv V= = =
2.The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average
power rating.
3.The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.
4.Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.
But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be
derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac
currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction
Reprint 2025-26
199Alternating Current
with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to
zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property
that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating
is such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of
alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same
average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce
under the same conditions.
5.In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one
should take care of their phases properly. For example, if VR and VC
are voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the
total voltage across RC combination is 2 2
RC R CV V V= +  and not
VR + VC since VC is p/2 out of phase of VR.
6.Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by
vectors, the se quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are
scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of
harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same
way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding
magnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide
us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that
we already know as the law of vector addition.
7.There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure
inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy
in an ac  circuit is the resistive element.
8.In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when XL = XC or
01
LCω= . For r esonance to occur , the pr esence of both L and C
elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these ( L or C)
elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence ,
no resonance is possible.
9.The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the
circuit is to expending the maximum power .
10.In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are
reversed. In a motor , electric ener gy is the input and mechanical
energy is the output. In a generator , mechanical ener gy is the
input and electric energy  is the output. Both devices simply
transfor m ener gy fr om one for m to another .
11.A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.
This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The
current is reduced by the same proportion.
