CHAPTER  SIX
SYSTEMS  OF PARTICLES  AND ROTATIONAL  MOTION
6.1 INTRODUCTION
In the earlier chapters we primarily consider ed the motion
of a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a
point mass having no size.)  W e applied the r esults of our
study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming
that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the
motion of a particle.
Any r eal body which we encounter in daily life has a
finite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies
(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is
inadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this
inadequacy.  W e shall attempt to build an understanding of
the motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the
first place, is a system of particles.  W e shall begin with the
consideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centr e
of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept her e.
We shall discuss the motion of the centr e of mass of a system
of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding
the motion of extended bodies.
A lar ge class of pr oblems with extended bodies can be
solved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a
rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and
unchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of
particles of such a body do not change.  It is evident fr om
this definition of a rigid body that no r eal body is truly rigid,
since r eal bodies defor m under the influence of for ces. But in
many situations the defor mations ar e negligible.  In a number
of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel
beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignor e
that they warp  (twist out of shape) , bend or vibrate and treat
them as rigid.
6.1.1  What kind of motion can a rigid body have?
Let us try to explor e this question by taking some examples
of the motion of rigid bodies.  Let us begin with a r ectangular6.1 Introduction

block sliding down an inclined plane without any
sidewise movement.  The block is taken as a rigid
body.  Its motion down the plane is such that all
the particles of the body ar e moving together ,
i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant
of time. The rigid body here is in pure
translational motion (Fig. 6.1).
In pure translational motion at any
instant of time, all particles of the body have
the same velocity.
Consider now the r olling motion of a solid
metallic or wooden cylinder down the same
inclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this
problem, namely the cylinder , shifts fr om the
top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,
seems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.
6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with
the same velocity at any instant. The body,
therefore, is not in pure translational motion.
Its motion is translational plus ‘something else.’
In order to understand what this ‘something
else’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained
that it cannot have translational motion.  Themost common way to constrain a rigid body so
that it does not have translational motion is to
fix it along a straight line. The only possible
motion of such a rigid body is rotation . The line
or fixed axis about which the body is rotating is
its axis of rotation . If you look around, you will
come across many examples of rotation about
an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant
wheel in a fair , a merry-go-r ound and so on (Fig
6.3(a) and (b)).

Let us try to understand what rotation is,
what characterises r otation.  Y ou may notice that

every particle of the body moves in a circle,
which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis .  Fig. 6.4 shows
the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis (the z -axis of the frame of reference).  Let P1
be a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen
and at a distance r1 from fixed axis.  The particle
P1 describes a circle of radius  r1 with its centre
C1 on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane
perpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows
another particle P2 of the rigid body, P2 is at a
distance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P2
moves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2
on the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane
perpendicular to the axis.  Note that the circles
described by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes;
both these planes, however , are perpendicular
to the fixed axis.  For any particle on the axis
like P3, r = 0. Any such particle remains
stationary while the body rotates.  This is
expected since the axis of rotation is fixed.Fig. 6.5 (a) A spinning top
(The point of contact of the top with the
ground, its tip O, is fixed.)
Fig. 6.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating
blades. The pivot of the fan, point O, is
fixed. The blades of the fan are under
rotational motion, whereas, the axis of
rotation of  the fan blades is oscillating.

point of the body such as P1 or
P2 describes a circle with its centre (C1
or C2) on the axis of rotation.  The radius of
the circle (r1or r2) is the perpendicular
distance of the point (P1 or P2) from the
axis. A point on the axis like P3 remains
stationary).Axis of oscillation

In some examples of r otation, however , the
axis may not be fixed.  A pr ominent example of
this kind of r otation is a top spinning in place
[Fig. 6.5(a)].  (W e assume that the top does not
slip fr om place to place and so does not have
translational motion.)  W e know fr om experience
that the axis of such a spinning top moves
around the vertical thr ough its point of contact
with the gr ound, sweeping out a cone as shown
in Fig. 6.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of the
top ar ound the vertical is ter med precession .)
Note, the point of contact of the top with
ground is fixed . The axis of r otation of the top
at any instant passes thr ough the point of
contact. Another simple example of this kind of
rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal
fan [Fig.6.5(b)]. Y ou may have observed that the
Reprint 2025-26
SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 95
axis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating
(sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about
the vertical through the point at which the axis
is pivoted (point O in Fig. 6.5(b)).
While the fan r otates and its axis moves
sidewise, this point is fixed.  Thus, in mor e
general cases of r otation, such as the r otation
of a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not
one line,  of the rigid body is fixed. In this case
the axis is not fixed, though it always passes
through the fixed point. In our study, however ,
we mostly deal with the simpler and special case
of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis
only unless stated otherwise.
The r olling motion of a cylinder down an
inclined plane is a combination of r otation about
a fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the
‘something else’ in the case of r olling motion
which we r eferred to earlier is r otational motion.
You will find Fig. 6.6(a) and (b) instructive fr om
this point of view. Both these figures show
motion of the same body along identical
translational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 6.6(a),
the motion is a pur e translation; in the other
case [Fig. 6.6(b)] it is a combination of translation
and r otation. (Y ou may try to r eproduce the two
types of motion shown, using a rigid object like
a heavy book.)
We now r ecapitulate the most important
observations of the present section: The motion
of a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in
some way is either a pure translation or a
combination of translation and rotation. The
motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed
in some way is rotation.   The rotation may be
about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or
moving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.6.5(b)] ).
We shall, in the pr esent chapter , consider
rotational motion about a fixed axis only.
6.2  CENTRE OF MASS
We shall first see what the centr e of mass of a
system of particles is and then discuss its
significance. For simplicity we shall start with
a two particle system. W e shall take the line
joining the two particles to be the x- axis.

Let the distances of the two particles be x1
and x2 respectively fr om some origin O. Let m1
and m2 be r espectively the masses of the twoFig. 6.6(a) Motion of a rigid body which is pure
translation.

combination of translation and
rotation.
Fig 6.6 (a) and 6.6 (b) illustrate different motions of
the same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the
body; O is the centr e of mass of the body, which is
defined in the next section. Suf fice to say her e that
the trajectories of O ar e the translational trajectories
Tr1 and T r2 of the body. The positions O and P at
three dif ferent instants of time ar e shown by O1, O2,
and O3, and P1, P2 and P3, respectively, in both
Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b) . As seen from Fig. 6.6(a), at any
instant the velocities of any particles like O and P of
the body ar e the same in pur e translation. Notice, in
this case the orientation of OP , i.e. the angle OP makes
with a fixed dir ection, say the horizontal, r emains
the same, i.e. α1 = α2 = α3. Fig. 6.6 (b) illustrates a case
of combination of translation and rotation. In this case,
at any instants the velocities of O and P dif fer. Also,
α1, α2 and α3 may all be different.

particles. The centre of mass of the system is
that   point C which is at a distance X from O,
wher e X is given by

In Eq. (6.1), X can be regarded as the mass-
weighted mean of  x1 and x2. If the two particles
have the same mass m1 = m2 = m, then

Thus, for two particles of equal mass the
centr e of mass lies exactly midway between
them.
       If we have n particles of masses m1, m2,
...mn respectively, along a straight line taken as
the 
x- axis, then by definition the position of the
centre of the mass of the system of particles is
given by.

where  x1, x2,...xn are the distances of the
particles from the origin;  X is also measured from
the same origin. The symbol ∑(the Greek letter
sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n
particles. The sum

is the total mass of the system.
Suppose that we have thr ee particles, not
lying in a straight line. We may define x– and y–
axes in the plane in which the particles lie and
represent the positions of the thr ee particles by
coordinates ( x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.
Let the masses of the thr ee particles be m1, m2and m3 respectively. The centr e of mass C of
the system of the thr ee particles is defined and
located by the coor dinates ( X, Y) given by

Thus, for three particles of equal mass, the
centre of mass coincides with the centroid of the
triangle formed by the particles.
Results of Eqs. (6.3a) and (6.3b) are
generalised easily to a system of n particles, not
necessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in
space. The centr e of mass of such a system is
at (X, Y, Z ), wher e
i im xXM=∑(6.4a)
i im yYM=∑(6.4b)
and  i im zZM=∑(6.4c)
Here M = im∑ is the total mass of the
system. The index i runs fr om 1 to n; mi is the
mass of the ith particle and the position of the
ith particle is given by ( xi, yi, zi).
Eqs. (6.4a), (6.4b) and (6.4c) can be
combined into one equation using the notation
of position vectors. Let  ir be the position vector
of the ith particle and R be the position vector of
the centr e of mass:

i i i ix y z= + +r i j kɵ ɵ
and X Y Z= + +R i j kɵ ɵ
Then  i im

The sum on the right hand side is a vector
sum.
Note the economy of expressions we achieve
by use of vectors. If the origin of the frame of
reference (the coor dinate system) is chosen to
be the centr e of mass then  0i im=∑r for the
given system of particles.
A rigid body, such as a metre stick or a
flywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;
Eqs. (6.4a), (6.4b), (6.4c) and (6.4d) are therefore,
applicable to a rigid body. The number of
particles (atoms or molecules) in such a body is
so large that it is impossible to carry out the
summations over individual particles in these
equations. Since the spacing of the particles is
Reprint 2025-26
SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 97
small, we can treat the body as a continuous
distribution of mass. W e subdivide the body into
n small elements of mass;  ∆m1, ∆m2... ∆mn; the
ith element  ∆mi is taken to be located about the
point  ( xi, yi, zi). The coordinates of the centre of
mass are then approximately given by
( ) ( ) ( ), ,i i i i i i

As we make n bigger and bigger and each
∆mi smaller and smaller , these expr essions
become exact. In that case, we denote the sums
over i by integrals. Thus,
∆m m Mi→ =∫∑ d ,
( ) , ∆m x x mi i→∫ ∑ d
( ) , ∆m y y mi i→∫ ∑ d
 and(∆m z z mi i)→∫ ∑ d
Here M is the total mass of the body. The
coordinates of the centr e of mass now ar e

Often we have to calculate the centre of mass of
homogeneous bodies of regular shapes like rings,
discs, spheres, rods etc. (By a homogeneous body
we mean a body with uniformly distributed
mass.) By using symmetry consideration, we can
easily show that the centres of mass of these
bodies lie at their geometric centres.Let us consider a thin rod, whose width and
breath (in case the cross section of the rod is
rectangular) or radius (in case the cross section
of the r od is cylindrical) is much smaller than
its length. T aking the origin to be at the
geometric centr e of the r od and x-axis to be
along the length of the r od, we can say that on
account of r eflection symmetry, for every
element dm of the r od at x, ther e is an element
of the same mass dm located at – x (Fig. 6.8).
The net contribution of every such pair to
the integral and hence the integral  itself
is zero.  From Eq. (6.6), the point for which the
integral  itself is zer o, is the centr e of mass.
Thus, the centr e of mass of a homogenous thin
rod coincides with its geometric centr e. This can
be understood on the basis of r eflection symmetry.
The same symmetry ar gument will apply to
homogeneous rings, discs, spher es, or even
thick r ods of cir cular or r ectangular cr oss
section. For all such bodies you will r ealise that
for every element  dm at a point ( x, y, z) one can
always take an element of the same mass at
the point (– x, –y, – z). (In other wor ds, the origin
is a point of r eflection symmetry for these
bodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (6.5 a)
all ar e zero. This means that for all the above
bodies, their centr e of mass coincides with their
geometric centr e.

Example 6.2   Find the centre of mass of a
triangular lamina.
Answer  The lamina (∆LMN) may be subdivided
into narr ow strips each parallel to the base (MN)
as shown in Fig. 6.10
Fig. 6.10
By symmetry each strip has its centr e of
mass at its midpoint. If we join the midpoint of
all the strips we get the median LP . The centr e
of mass of the triangle as a whole therefore, has
to lie on the median LP . Similarly, we can ar gue
that it lies on the median MQ and NR. This
means the centre of mass lies on the point ofconcurrence of the medians, i.e. on the centroid
G of the triangle.       ⊳
Example 6.3 Find the centre of mass of a

Answer  Choosing the X and Y axes as shown
in Fig. 6.11 we have the coordinates of the
vertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the
figur e. W e can think of the
L-shape to consist of 3 squar es each of length
1m. The mass of each squar e is 1kg, since the
lamina is unifor m. The centr es of mass C1, C2
and C3 of the squar es ar e, by symmetry, their
geometric centr es and have coor dinates (1/2,1/2),
(3/2,1/2), (1/2,3/2) r espectively. W e take the
masses of the squar es to be concentrated at
these points. The centr e of mass of the whole
L shape ( X, Y) is the centr e of mass of these
mass points.

then determine the centre of mass of the lamina?
⊳
6.3  MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS
Equipped with the definition of the centr e of
mass, we ar e now in a position to discuss its
physical importance for a system of n particles.
We may r ewrite Eq.(6.4d) as
1 1 2 2 ...i i n n M m m m m= = + + +∑R r r r r (6.7)
Differentiating the two sides of the equation
with r espect to time we get
1 2
1 2d d d d...d d dn
n M m m mt t t dt= + + +r r r R
or
1 1 2 2 ...n n M m m m= + + +V v v v (6.8)
where  ( )1 1d /d t=v r  is the velocity of the first
particle ( )2 2d dt=v r is the velocity of the
second particle etc. and d /d t =V R  is the
velocity of the centr e of mass. Note that we
assumed the masses m1, m2, ... etc. do not
change in time. W e have ther efore, treated them
as constants in dif ferentiating the equations
with r espect to time.
Differentiating Eq.(6.8) with respect to time,
we obtain
1 2
1 2d d d d...d d d dn
n M m m mt t t t= + + +v v v V
or
1 1 2 2 ...n n M m m m= + + +A a a a (6.9)
where ( )1 1d /d t =a v  is the acceleration of the
first particle,  ( )2 2d /d t =a v  is the acceleration
of the second particle etc. and  ( ) d /d t =A V  is
the acceleration of the centr e of mass of the
system of particles.
Now, fr om Newton’s second law, the for ce
acting on the first particle is given by 1 1 1m=F a .
The for ce acting on the second particle is given
by 2 2 2m=F a and so on. Eq. (6.9) may be written
as
1 2 ...n M= + + +A F F F (6.10)Thus, the total mass of a system of particles
times the acceleration of its centre of mass is
the vector sum of all the forces acting on the
system of particles.
Note when we talk of the for ce 1Fon the first
particle, it is not a single for ce, but the vector
sum of all the for ces on the first particle; likewise
for the second particle etc. Among these for ces
on each particle ther e will be exter nal forces
exerted by bodies outside the system and also
inter nal forces exerted by the particles on one
another . We know fr om Newton’s thir d law that
these inter nal for ces occur in equal and opposite
pairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (6.10), their
contribution is zero. Only the external forces
contribute to the equation. W e can then r ewrite
Eq. (6.10) as
ext M=A F (6.11)
where extF represents the sum of all external
forces acting on the particles of the system.
Eq. (6.11) states that the centre of mass of
a system of particles moves as if all the mass
of the  system was concentrated at the centre
of mass and all the external forces were
applied at that point.
Notice, to deter mine the motion of the centr e
of mass no knowledge of inter nal for ces of the
system of particles is r equir ed; for this purpose
we need to know only the exter nal for ces.
To obtain Eq. (6.11) we did not need to specify
the nature of the system of particles. The system
may be a collection of particles in which there
may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may
be a rigid body which has either pure
translational motion or a combination of
translational and rotational motion. Whatever
is the system and the motion of its individual
particles, the centre of mass moves according
to Eq. (6.11).
Instead of tr eating extended bodies as single
particles as we have done in earlier chapters,
we can now tr eat them as systems of particles.
We can obtain the translational component of
their motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass
of the system, by taking the mass of the whole
system to be concentrated at the centr e of mass
and all the external forces on the system to be
acting at the centre of mass.
This is the pr ocedur e that we followed earlier
in analysing for ces on bodies and solving
Reprint 2025-26
100 PHYSICS
problems without explicitly outlining and
justifying the pr ocedur e. We now r ealise that in
earlier studies we assumed, without saying so,
that r otational motion and/or inter nal motion
of the particles wer e either absent or negligible.
We no longer need to do this. W e have not only
found the justification of the pr ocedur e we
followed earlier; but we also have found how to
describe and separate the translational motion
of (1) a rigid body which may be r otating as
well,  or (2) a system of particles with all kinds
of inter nal motion.
Fig. 6.12 The centre of mass of the fragments
of the pr ojectile continues along the
same parabolic path which it would
have followed if ther e wer e no
explosion.
Figure 6.12 is a good illustration of Eq. (6.11).
A projectile, following the usual parabolic
trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in
air. The for ces leading to the explosion ar e
internal for ces. They contribute nothing to the
motion of the centr e of mass. The total exter nal
force, namely, the for ce of gravity acting on the
body, is the same befor e and after the explosion.
The centr e of mass under the influence of the
exter nal for ce continues, ther efore, along the
same parabolic trajectory as it would have
followed if ther e wer e no explosion.
6.4LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF
PARTICLES
Let us r ecall that the linear momentum of a
particle is defined as
m=p v (6.12)
Let us also recall that Newton’s second law
written in symbolic form for a single particle is
d
dt=pF (6.13)where F is the force on the particle. Let us
consider a system of n particles with masses m1,
m2,...mn respectively and velocities 1 2, ,.......n v v v
respectively. The particles may be interacting
and have external forces acting on them. The
linear momentum of the first particle is 1 1mv,
of the second particle is 2 2mv and so on.
For the system of n particles, the linear
momentum of the system is defined to be the
vector sum of all individual particles of the

Comparing this with Eq. (6.8)

Suppose now, that the sum of external
forces acting on a system of particles is zer o.

Thus, when the total external force acting
on a system of particles is zer o, the total linear
momentum of the system is constant. This is
the law of conservation of the total linear
momentum of a system of particles. Because of
Eq. (6.15), this also means that when the
total exter nal for ce on the system is zer o
the velocity of the centr e of mass r emains
constant. (W e assume thr oughout the
discussion on systems of particles in this
chapter that the total mass of the system
remains constant.)

force acting on the system is zero, the centre of

The vector Eq. (6.18a) is equivalent to three
scalar equations,

As an example, let us consider the
radioactive decay of a moving unstable particle,
like the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus
disintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an
alpha particle. The for ces leading to the decay
are inter nal to the system and the exter nal
forces on the system ar e negligible. So the total
linear momentum of the system is the same
befor e and after decay. The two particles
produced in the decay, the radon nucleus and
the alpha particle, move in dif ferent dir ections
in such a way that their centr e of mass moves
along the same path along which the original
decaying radium nucleus was moving
[Fig. 6.13(a)].
If we observe the decay fr om the frame of
reference in which the centre of mass is at rest,
the motion of the particles involved in the decay
looks particularly simple; the product particlesmove back to back with their centre of mass
remaining at rest as shown in Fig.6.13 (b).
In many problems on the system of
particles , as in the above radioactive decay
problem, it is convenient to work in the centr e
of mass frame rather than in the laboratory
frame of r eference.
In astr onomy, binary (double) stars is a
common occurr ence. If ther e are no exter nal
forces, the centre of mass of a double star
moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.6.14
(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal
mass ar e also shown in the figur e; they look
complicated. If we go to the centr e of mass
frame, then we find that ther e the two stars
are moving in a cir cle, about the centr e of
mass, which is at r est. Note that the position
of the stars have to be diametrically opposite
to each other [Fig. 6.14(b) ]. Thus  in our frame
of reference,  the trajectories of the stars ar e a
combination of (i) unifor m motion in a straight
line of the centr e of mass and (ii) cir cular
orbits of the stars about the centr e of mass.
As can be seen fr om the two examples,
separating  the motion of dif ferent parts of a
system into motion of the centre of mass and
motion about the centre of mass  is a very
useful technique that helps in understanding
the motion of the system.

important physical quantity, work, is defined as
a scalar product of two vector quantities, force
and displacement.(a) (b)

We shall now define another pr oduct of two
vectors. This product is a vector . Two important
quantities in the study of rotational motion,
namely, moment of a for ce and angular
momentum, ar e defined as vector pr oducts.
Definition of V ector Pr oduct
A vector pr oduct of two vectors a and b is a
vector c such that
(i)magnitude of c = c sinabθ =  wher e a and b
are magnitudes of  a and b and θ is the
angle between the two vectors.
(ii)c is perpendicular to the plane containing
a and b.
(iii)if we take a right handed scr ew with its head
lying in the plane of  a and b and the scr ew
perpendicular to this plane, and if we tur n
the head in the dir ection fr om  a to b, then
the tip of the scr ew advances in the dir ection
of c. This right handed scr ew rule is
illustrated in Fig. 6.15a.
Alternately, if one curls up the fingers of
right hand ar ound a line perpendicular to the
plane of the vectors  a and b and if the fingers
are curled up in the dir ection fr om a to b, then
the str etched thumb points in the dir ection of
c, as shown in Fig. 6.15b.

defining the dir ection of the vector
product of two vectors.
                (b) Rule of the right hand for defining the
direction of the vector product.A simpler version of the right hand rule is
the following : Open up your right hand palm
and curl the fingers pointing fr om  a to b. Your
stretched thumb points in the dir ection of c.
It should be r emember ed that ther e are two
angles between any two vectors  a and b . In
Fig. 6.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to θ (as shown)
and (3600– θ). While applying either of the above
rules, the rotation should be taken through the
smaller angle (<1800) between  a and b. It is θ
here.
Because of the cross (×) used to denote the
vector product, it is also referred to as cross product.
•Note that scalar product of two vectors is
commutative as said earlier , a.b = b.a
The vector pr oduct, however , is not
commutative, i.e. a × b ≠ b × a
The magnitude of both a × b and b × a is the
same ( sinabθ); also, both of them ar e
perpendicular to the plane of  a and b. But the
rotation of the right-handed scr ew in case of
a × b  is fr om  a to b, wher eas in case of  b × a it
is from b to a. This means the two vectors ar e
in opposite dir ections. W e have
× = − ×a b b a
•Another inter esting pr operty of a vector
product is its behaviour under r eflection.
Under reflection (i.e. on taking the plane
mirror image) we have
and , x x y y z z→ − → − → − . As a result all
the components of a vector change sign and
thus , a a→ − b b→ − . What happens to
a × b under reflection?
a × b( ) ( )→ − × − = ×a b a b
Thus, a × b does not change sign under
reflection.
•Both scalar and vector products are
distributive with respect to vector addition.
Thus,
.( ) . .+ = +a b c a b a c
( )× + = × + ×a b c a b a c
•We may write c = a × b in the component
form. For this we first need to obtain some
elementary cr oss pr oducts:
(i) a × a = 0 (0 is a null vector , i.e. a vector
with zer o magnitude)
This follows since magnitude of a × a  is
2sin0 0a°=.

6.6ANGULAR VELOCITY AND ITS RELATION
WITH LINEAR VELOCITY
In this section we shall study what is angular
velocity and its r ole in r otational motion. W e
have seen that every particle of a r otating body
moves in a cir cle. The linear velocity of the
particle is r elated to the angular velocity. The
relation between these two quantities involves
a vector product which we learnt about in the
last section.
Let us go back to Fig. 6.4. As said above, in
rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis, every particle of the body moves in a cir cle,
Fig. 6.16 Rotation about a fixed axis. (A particle ( P)
of the rigid body r otating about the fixed
(z-) axis moves in a cir cle with centr e (C)
on the axis.)
which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 6.16 we
redraw Fig. 6.4, showing a typical particle (at a
point P) of the rigid body r otating about a fixed
axis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes
Reprint 2025-26
104 PHYSICS
a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius
of the cir cle is r, the perpendicular distance of
the point P from the axis. W e also show the
linear velocity vector v of the particle at P . It is
along the tangent at P to the cir cle.
Let P ′ be the position of the particle after an
interval of time ∆t (Fig. 6.16). The angle PCP ′
describes the angular displacement ∆θ of the
particle in time ∆t. The average angular velocity
of the particle over the interval  ∆t is ∆θ/∆t. As
∆t tends to zer o (i.e. takes smaller and smaller
values), the ratio ∆θ/∆t approaches a limit which
is the instantaneous angular velocity d θ/dt of
the particle at the position P . We denote the
instantaneous angular velocity  by  ω (the
Greek letter omega). W e know fr om our study
of cir cular motion that the magnitude of linear
velocity  v of a particle moving in a cir cle is
related to the angular velocity of the particle ω
by the simple r elation r υ ω=, wher e r is the
radius of the cir cle.
We observe that at any given instant the
relation  v rω= applies to  all particles of the
rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular
distance ri  from the fixed axis, the linear velocity
at a given instant vi is given by
i iv rω= (6.19)
The index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the
total number of particles of the body.
For particles on the axis, 0=r , and hence
v = ω r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are
stationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.
Note that we use the same angular velocity
ω for all the particles. We therefore, refer to  ω ωω ωω
as the angular velocity of the whole body .
We have characterised pure translation of
a body by all parts of the body having the same
velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we
may characterise pure rotation by all parts of
the body having the same angular velocity at
any instant of time . Note that this
characterisation of the r otation of a rigid body
about a fixed axis is just another way  of saying
as in Sec. 6.1 that each particle of the body moves
in a cir cle, which lies in a plane perpendicular
to the axis and has the centr e on the axis.
In our discussion so far the angular velocity
appears to be a scalar . In fact, it is a vector . We
shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept
it. For r otation about a fixed axis, the angular
velocity vector lies along the axis of r otation,and points out in the direction in which a right
handed screw would advance, if the head of the
screw is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 6.17a).
The magnitude of this vector is d dtω θ=
referred as above.
Fig. 6.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw
rotates with the body, the scr ew
advances in the dir ection of the angular
velocity ω ωω ωω. If the sense (clockwise or
anticlockwise) of rotation of the body
changes, so does the dir ection of ω ωω ωω.
Fig. 6.17 (b) The angular velocity vector ω ωω ωω is directed
along the fixed axis as shown. The linear
velocity of the particle at P is v = ω ωω ωω × r.
It is  perpendicular to both ω ω ω ω ω and r and
is  directed along the tangent to the circle
described by the particle.
We shall now look at what the vector
product ω ωω ωω × r corresponds to. Refer to Fig.
6.17(b) which is a part of Fig. 6.16 reproduced
to show the path of the particle P . The figur e
shows the vector ω ωω ωω directed along the fixed ( z–)
axis and also the position vector  r = OP of the
particle at P of the rigid body with respect to
the origin O. Note that the origin is chosen to
be on the axis of rotation.
Reprint 2025-26
SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 105
Now ω ωω ωω × r = ω ωωωω × OP = ω ωω ωω × (OC + CP)
But ω ωω ωω × OC = 0 0 0 0 0 as ω ω ω ω ω is along OC
Hence ω ωω ωω × r = ω ωω ωω × CP
The vector ω ωω ωω × CP is perpendicular to ω ωω ωω, i.e.
to the z-axis and also to CP, the radius of the
circle described by the particle at P . It is
therefore, along the tangent to the cir cle at P .
Also, the magnitude of  ω ωω ωω × CP is ω (CP) since
ω ωω ωω and CP are perpendicular to each other . We
shall denote CP by ⊥r and not by r, as we did
earlier .
Thus, ωωωωω × r is a vector of magnitude ωr⊥
and is along the tangent to the circle described
by the particle at P . The linear velocity vector v
at P has the same magnitude and direction.
Thus,
v = ω  ω ω  ω ω × r (6.20)
In fact, the relation, Eq. (6.20), holds good
even for r otation of a rigid body with one point
fixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 6.6(a)].
In this case r represents the position vector of
the particle with r espect to the fixed point taken
as the origin.
We note that for rotation about a fixed
axis, the direction of the vector ω
ωω ωω does not
change with time. Its magnitude may,
however, change from instant to instant. For
the more general rotation, both the
magnitude and the direction of ω ω ω ω ω may change
from instant to instant.
6.6.1  Angular acceleration
You may have noticed that we ar e developing
the study of r otational motion along the lines
of the study of translational motion with which
we are alr eady familiar . Analogous to the kinetic
variables of linear displacement (s) and velocity
(v) in translational motion, we have angular
displacement ( θ θθ θθ) and angular velocity ( ωωω
ωω) in
rotational motion. It is then natural to define
in rotational motion the concept of angular
acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration
defined as the time rate of change of velocity in
translational motion. W e define angular
acceleration α αα αα as the time rate of change of
angular velocity. Thus,
d
dt=ωα (6.21)If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction
of ω ω ω ω ω and hence, that of ααα
αα is fixed. In this case
the vector equation reduces to a scalar equation
d
dtωα= (6.22)
6.7  TORQUE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
In this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with
two physical quantities  (torque and angular
momentum)  which are defined as vector products
of two vectors. These as we shall see, are
especially important in the discussion of motion
of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.
6.7.1  Moment of force (Torque)
We have lear nt that the motion of a rigid body,
in general, is a combination of rotation and
translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along
a line, it has only r otational motion. W e know
that force is needed to change the translational
state of a body, i.e. to produce linear
acceleration. W e may then ask, what is the
analogue of force in the case of rotational
motion? To look into the question in a concrete
situation let us take the example of opening or
closing of a door . A door is a rigid body which
can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing
through the hinges. What makes the door
rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied
the door does not rotate. But any force does not
do the job. A force applied to the hinge line
cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a
force of given magnitude applied at right angles
to the door at its outer edge is most effective in
producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but
how and where the force is applied is important
in rotational motion.
The rotational analogue of force in linear
motion is moment of force . It is also referred to
as torque or couple . (We shall use the wor ds
moment of force and torque interchangeably.)
We shall first define the moment of for ce for the
special case of a single particle. Later on we
shall extend the concept to systems of particles
including rigid bodies. W e shall also r elate it to
a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is
angular acceleration of a rigid body.

If a for ce acts on a single particle at a point
P whose position with r espect to the origin O is
given by the position vector r (Fig. 6.18), the
moment of the for ce acting on the particle with
respect to the origin O is defined as the vector
product
τ ττ ττ = r × F (6.23)
The moment of force (or torque) is a vector
quantity. The symbol τ τ τ τ τ stands for the Gr eek
letter tau. The magnitude of τ τ τ 
τ τ is
τ = r F sinθ (6.24a)
where r is the magnitude of the position vector
r, i.e. the length OP , F is the magnitude of for ce
F and θ     is the angle between r and F as
shown.
Moment of for ce has dimensions M L2 T -2.
Its dimensions ar e the same as those of work
or ener gy. It is, however , a very dif ferent physical
quantity than work. Moment of a for ce is a
vector , while work is a scalar . The SI unit of
moment of for ce is newton metr e (N m). The
magnitude of the moment of for ce may be
written
( sin )r F r F τ θ⊥ = = (6.24b)
or sinr F rFτ θ⊥ = = (6.24c)
where r⊥ = r sinθ is the perpendicular distanceof the line of action of F from the origin and
( sin )F F θ⊥= is the component of F in the
direction perpendicular to r. Note that τ = 0 if
r = 0, F = 0 or θ = 00 or 1800 . Thus, the moment
of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of
the force is zero, or if the line of action of the
force passes through the origin.
One may note that since  r × F is a vector
product, pr operties of a vector pr oduct of two
vectors apply to it. If the dir ection of F is
reversed, the dir ection of the moment of for ce
is reversed. If dir ections of both r and F are
reversed, the dir ection of the moment of for ce
remains the same.
6.7.2  Angular momentum of a particle
Just as the moment of a for ce is the r otational
analogue of force in linear motion, the quantity
angular momentum is the rotational analogue
of linear momentum. W e shall first define
angular momentum for the special case of a
single particle and look at its usefulness in the
context of single particle motion. W e shall then
extend the definition of angular momentum to
systems of particles including rigid bodies.
Like moment of a force, angular momentum
is also a vector pr oduct. It could also be r eferred
to as moment of (linear) momentum. Fr om this
term one could guess how angular momentum
is defined.
Consider a particle of mass m and linear
momentum p at a position r relative to the origin
O. The angular momentum l of the particle with
respect to the origin O is defined to be
l = r × p (6.25a)
The magnitude of the angular momentum
vector is
sin l r p= θ (6.26a)
where p is the magnitude of p and θ is the angle
between r and p. We may write
l r p⊥ =  or r p⊥                                  (6.26b)
where r⊥ (= r sinθ) is the perpendicular distance
of the dir ectional line of  p from the origin and
( sin )p p θ⊥=  is the component of p in a dir ection
perpendicular to r. We expect the angular
momentum to be zero ( l = 0), if the linear
momentum vanishes ( p = 0), if the particle is at
the origin ( r = 0), or if the dir ectional line of  p
passes through the origin θ = 00 or 1800.

SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 107
The physical quantities, moment of a force
and angular momentum, have an important
relation between them. It is the rotational
analogue of the relation between force and linear
momentum. For deriving the relation in the
context of a single particle, we differentiate
l = r × p with respect to time,
r pd d( )d dt t= ×l
Applying the pr oduct rule for dif ferentiation
to the right hand side,
r pr p p rd d d( )d d d t t t× = × + ×
Now, the velocity of the particle is v = dr/dt
and p = m v
Because of this d0,dmt× = × =rp v v

Hence  d

Thus, the time rate of change of the angular
momentum of a particle is equal to the tor que
acting on it. This is the r otational analogue of
the equation F = dp/dt, which expr esses

of a single particle.
Torque and angular momentum for a system
of particles
To get the total angular momentum of a system
of particles about a given point we need to add
vectorially the angular momenta of individual
particles. Thus, for a system of n particles,
The angular momentum of the ith   particle
is given by
li = ri × pi
where ri is the position vector of the ith particle
with r espect to a given origin and p = (mivi) is
the linear momentum of the particle. (Theparticle has mass mi and velocity vi) We may
write the total angular momentum of a system
of particles as
(6.25b)
This is a generalisation of the definition of
angular momentum (Eq. 6.25a) for a single
particle to a system of particles.

(We leave it to you to find out how the tor que is

point  (taken as the origin of our frame of
reference)  is equal to the sum of the external
torques  (i.e. the torques due to external forces)
acting on the system taken about the same
point . Eq. (6.28 b) is the generalisation of the
single particle case of Eq. (6.23) to a system of
particles. Note that when we have only one
particle, there are no internal forces or torques.
Eq.(6.28 b) is the rotational analogue of
d
dPFtext= (6.17)Note that like Eq.(6.17), Eq.(6.28b) holds
good for any system of particles, whether it is a
rigid body or its individual particles have all
kinds of internal motion.
Conservation of angular momentum
If τ ττττext = 0, Eq. (6.28b) reduces to
Ld0dt=
or         L = constant. (6.29a)
Thus, if the total external torque on a system
of particles is zer o, then the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved, i.e.
remains constant. Eq. (6.29a) is equivalent to
three scalar equations,
Lx = K1, Ly = K2 and Lz = K3(6.29 b)
Here K1, K2 and K3 are constants; Lx, Ly and
Lz are the components of the total angular
momentum vector L along the x,y and z axes
respectively. The statement that the total
angular momentum is conserved means that
each of these thr ee components is conserved.
Eq. (6.29a) is the rotational analogue of
Eq. (6.18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total
linear momentum for a system of  particles.
Like Eq. (6.18a), it has applications in many
practical situations. W e shall look at a few of
the interesting applications later on in
this chapter .

Answer Let the particle with velocity v  be at
point P  at some instant t. We want to calculate
the angular momentum of the particle about an
arbitrary point O.
Fig 6.19
The angular momentum is l = r × mv. Its
magnitude is mvr sinθ, wher e θ is the angle
between r and v as shown in Fig. 6.19. Although
the particle changes position with time, the line
of dir ection of v remains the same and hence
OM = r sin θ. is a constant.
Further , the dir ection of l is perpendicular
to the plane of r and v. It is into the page of the
figure.This direction does not change with time.
Thus, l remains the same in magnitude and
direction and is ther efore conserved. Is ther e
any exter nal tor que on the particle? ⊳
6.8  EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY
We are now going to concentrate on the motion
of rigid bodies rather than on the motion of
general systems of particles.
We shall r ecapitulate what ef fect the
external forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth
we shall omit the adjective ‘external ’ because
unless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only
external forces and torques.) The forces change
the translational state of the motion of the rigid
body, i.e. they change its total linear
momentum in accordance with Eq. (6.17). But
this is not the only effect the forces have. The
total torque on the body may not vanish. Such
a torque changes the rotational state of motion
of the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular
momentum of the body in accordance with
Eq. (6.28 b).
A rigid body is said to be in mechanical
equilibrium, if both its linear momentum and
angular momentum are not changing with time,
or equivalently, the body has neither linearacceleration nor angular acceleration. This means
(1)the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the
forces, on the rigid body is zero;
F F F F1 2
1+ + + = =
=∑ ...n i

0 (6.30a)
If the total force on the body is zero, then
the total linear momentum of the body does
not change with time. Eq. (6.30a) gives the
condition for the translational equilibrium
of the body.
(2)The total tor que, i.e. the vector sum of the
torques on the rigid body is zero,
1 21+ + + = =
=∑ ...n i
in
0 τ     τ           τ          τ (6.30b)
If the total torque on the rigid body is zero,
the total angular momentum of the body does
not change with time. Eq. (6.30 b) gives the
condition for the rotationa l equilibrium of the
body.
One may raise a question, whether the
rotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 6.30(b)]
remains valid, if the origin with respect to which
the torques are taken is shifted. One can show
that if the translational equilibrium condition
[Eq. 6.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a
shift of origin does not matter , i.e. the r otational
equilibrium condition is independent of the
location of the origin about which the torques
are taken. Example 6.7 gives a proof of this result
in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces
acting on a rigid body in translational
equilibrium. The generalisation of this result to
n forces is left as an exercise.
Eq. (6.30a) and Eq. (6.30b), both, are vector
equations. They are equ ivalent to three scalar
equations each. Eq. (6.30a) corresponds to

conditions to be satisfied for mechanical

equilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of
problems all the forces acting on the body are
coplanar . Then we need only thr ee conditions
to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two
of these conditions correspond to translational
equilibrium; the sum of the components of the
forces along any two perpendicular axes in the
plane must be zero. The third condition
corresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum
of the components of the torques along any axis
perpendicular to the plane of the forces must
be zero.
The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body
may be compared with those for a particle, which
we considered in earlier chapters. Since
consideration of rotational motion does not apply
to a particle, only the conditions for translational
equilibrium (Eq. 6.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus,
for equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of
all the forces on it must be zero. Since all these
forces act on the single particle, they must be
concurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent
forces was discussed in the earlier chapters.
A body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it
may be in translational equilibrium and not in
rotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational
equilibrium and not in translational
equilibrium.
Consider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod
(AB) as shown in Fig. 6.20(a). At the two ends (A
and B) of which two parallel forces, both  equal
in magnitude and acting along same direction
are applied perpendicular to the rod.
Fig. 6.20 (a)
Let C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.
the moment of the for ces at A and B will both
be equal in magnitude ( aF), but opposite in
sense as shown. The net moment on the rod will
be zero. The system will be in rotational
equilibrium, but it will not be in translational
equilibrium; F 0≠∑Fig. 6.20 (b)
The force at B in Fig. 6.20(a) is reversed in
Fig. 6.20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with
two forces of equal magnitude but acting in
opposite diretions applied perpendicular to the
rod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here
the moments of both the forces are equal, but
they are not opposite; they act in the same sense
and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The
total force on the body is zero; so the body is in
translational equilibrium; but it is not in
rotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not
fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.
rotation without translation).
A pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting
in opposite directions with different lines of
action is known as a couple or torque . A couple
produces rotation without translation.
When we open the lid of a bottle by tur ning
it, our fingers ar e applying a couple to the lid
[Fig. 6.21(a)]. Another known example is a
compass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as
shown in the Fig. 6.21(b). The earth’s magnetic
field exerts equal for ces on the north and south
poles. The for ce on the North Pole is towar ds
the north, and the for ce on the South Pole is
towar d the south. Except when the needle points
in the north-south direction; the two forces do
not have the same line of action. Thus there is
a couple  acting on the needle due to the earth’s
magnetic field.

the lid.

Answer
Fig. 6.22
Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 6.22
acting on a rigid body. The for ces F and - F act
respectively at points B and A. These points have
position vectors r1 and r2 with r espect to origin
O. Let us take the moments of the forces about
the origin.
The moment of the couple = sum of the
moments of the two for ces making the couple
= r1 × (–F) + r2 × F
= r2 × F – r1 × F
= (r2–r1) × F
But r1 + AB = r2, and hence AB = r2 – r1.
The moment of the couple, therefore, is
AB × F.
Clearly this is independent of the origin, the
point about which we took the moments of the
forces. ⊳
6.8.1  Principle of moments
An ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of
negligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along itslength. This point is called the fulcrum. A see-
saw on the children’s playground is a typical
example of a lever . Two for ces F1 and F2, parallel
to each other and usually perpendicular to the
lever , as shown her e, act on the lever at
distances d1 and d2 respectively from the fulcrum
as shown in Fig. 6.23.
Fig. 6.23
The lever is a system in mechanical
equilibrium. Let R be the r eaction of the support
at the fulcrum; R is dir ected opposite to the
forces  F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium,
R – F1 – F2 = 0 (i)
For considering r otational equilibrium we
take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum
of moments must be zer o,
d1F1 – d2F2 = 0 (ii)
Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise)
moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note
R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment
about the fulcrum.
In the case of the lever force F1 is usually
some weight to be lifted. It is called the load and
its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called the
load arm . Force F2 is the effort  applied to lift the
load; distance  d2 of the effort from the fulcrum
is the effort arm.
Eq. (ii) can be written as
d1F1 = d2 F2(6.32a)
or load arm × load = effort arm × effort
The above equation expr esses the principle
of moments for a lever . Incidentally the ratio
F1/F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);
M.A. =1 2
2 1F d
F d=(6.32b)
If the effort arm d2 is larger than the load
arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than
one. Mechanical advantage greater than one
means that a small effort can be used to lift a
large load. There are several examples of a lever
around you besides the see-saw. The beam of a
balance is a lever . Try to find mor e such

examples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and
effort arm, and the load and the load arm of the
lever in each case.
You may easily show that the principle of
moment holds even when the parallel forces  F1
and F2 are not perpendicular , but act at some
angle, to the lever .
6.8.2  Centre of gravity
Many of you may have the experience of
balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger .
Figure 6.24 illustrates a similar experiment that
you can easily per form. T ake an irr egular -
shaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow
tipped object like a pencil. Y ou can locate by trial
and error a point G on the cardboard where it
can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The
cardboard remains horizontal in this position.)
This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)
of the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides
a vertically upward force due to which the
cardboar d is in mechanical equilibrium. As
shown in the Fig. 6.24, the reaction of the tip is
equal and opposite to Mg and hence the
cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is
also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,
due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and
fall. There are torques on the card board due to
the forces of gravity like m1g, m2g ….  etc, acting
on the individual particles that make up the
cardboard.
Fig. 6.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a
pencil. The point of support, G, is the
centre of gravity.The CG of the cardboard is so located that
the total torque on it due to the forces m1g, m2g
….  etc. is zero.
If  ri is the position vector of the ith particle
of an extended body with respect to its CG, then
the tor que about the CG, due to the for ce of
gravity on the particle  is τττττi = ri × mi g. The total
gravitational tor que about the CG is zer o, i.e.
τ τ τ τgii im = = × =∑ ∑ r g 0 (6.33)
We may ther efore, define the CG of a body
as that point wher e the total gravitational tor que
on the body is zer o.
We notice that in Eq. (6.33), g is the same
for all particles, and hence it comes out of the
summation. This gives, since g is non-zer o,
∑mi ir = 0. Remember that the position vectors
(ri) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in
accordance with the reasoning given below
Eq. (6.4a) in Sec. 6.2, if the sum is zero, the origin
must be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,
the centre of gravity of the body coincides with
the centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-

uufree space. W e note that this is true because
the body being small,  g does not
vary fr om one point of the body to the other . If
the body is so extended that g varies from part
to part of the body, then the centre of gravity
and centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,
the two are different concepts. The centre of
mass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends
only on the distribution of mass of the body.
In Sec. 6.2 we found out the position of the
centr e of mass of several r egular , homogeneous
objects. Obviously the method used ther e gives
us also the centr e of gravity of these bodies, if
they ar e small enough.
Figure 6.25 illustrates another way of
determining the CG of an irregular shaped body
like a car dboar d. If you suspend the body fr om
some point like A, the vertical line thr ough A
passes thr ough the CG. W e mark the vertical
AA1. We then suspend the body thr ough other
points like B and C. The intersection of the
verticals gives the CG. Explain why the method
works. Since the body is small enough, the
method allows us to deter mine also its centr e
of mass.
Example 6.8   A metal bar 70 cm long and
4.00 kg in mass supported on two knife-
edges placed 10 cm from each end. A 6.00
kg load is suspended at 30 cm from one
end. Find the reactions at the knife-edges.
(Assume the bar to be of uniform cross
section and homogeneous.)
Answer
Fig. 6.26
Figure 6.26 shows the rod AB, the positions
of the knife edges K1 and K2 , the centr e of
gravity of the r od at G and the suspended load
at P.
Note the weight of the r od W acts at its
centr e of gravity G. The r od is unifor m in cr oss
section and homogeneous; hence G is at the
centr e of the r od; AB = 70 cm. AG = 35 cm, AP= 30 cm, PG = 5 cm, AK1= BK2 = 10 cm and K1G =
K2G = 25 cm. Also, W= weight of the rod = 4.00
kg and W1= suspended load = 6.00 kg;
R1 and R2 are the nor mal r eactions of the
support at the knife edges.
For translational equilibrium of the r od,
R1+R2 –W1 –W = 0 (i)
Note W1 and W act vertically down and R1
and R2 act vertically up.
For considering r otational equilibrium, we
take moments of the for ces. A convenient point
to take moments about is G. The moments of
R2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), wher eas the
moment of R1 is clockwise (-ve).
For rotational equilibrium,
–R1 (K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (K2G) = 0 (ii)
It is given that W = 4.00 g N and W1 = 6.00 g
N, wher e g = acceleration due to gravity. W e
take g = 9.8 m/s2.
With numerical values inserted, fr om (i)
R1 + R2 – 4.00 g – 6.00 g = 0
or R1 + R2 = 10.00 g  N (iii)
               = 98.00 N
From (ii), – 0.25 R1 + 0.05 W1 + 0.25 R2 = 0
or R1 – R2 = 1.2 g  N = 11.76 N (iv)
From (iii) and (iv), R1 = 54.88 N,
R2 = 43.12 N
Thus the reactions of the support are about
55 N at K1 and 43 N at K2.  ⊳

6.9  MOMENT OF INERTIA
We have alr eady mentioned that we ar e
developing the study of rotational motion parallel
to the study of translational motion with which
we ar e familiar . We have yet to answer one major
question in this connection. What is the
analogue of mass in rotational motion?  We shall
attempt to answer this question in the present
section. To keep the discussion simple, we shall
consider rotation about a fixed axis only. Let us
try to get an expression for the kinetic energy of
a rotating body . We know that for a body r otating
about a fixed axis, each particle of the body moves
in a circle with linear velocity given by Eq. (6.19).
(Refer to Fig. 6.16). For a particle at a distancefrom the axis, the  linear velocity is i ir υ ω=. The
kinetic energy of motion of this particle is
2 2 2 1 1
2 2i i i i i k m m r υ ω = =
where mi is the mass of the particle. The total
kinetic ener gy K of the body is then given by

Note that the parameter I is independent of
the magnitude of the angular velocity. It is a
characteristic of the rigid body and the axis
about which it r otates.
Compare Eq. (6.35) for the kinetic energy of
a rotating body with the expr ession for the
kinetic ener gy of a body in linear (translational)
motion,

Here, m is the mass of the body and v is its
velocity. W e have alr eady noted the analogy
between angular velocity ω (in respect of
rotational motion about a fixed axis) and linear
velocity v (in respect of linear motion). It is then
evident that the parameter , moment of inertia
I, is the desired rotational analogue of mass in
linear motion. In rotation (about a fixed axis),
the moment of inertia plays a similar role as
mass does in linear motion.
We now apply the definition Eq. (6.34), to
calculate the moment of inertia in two simple cases.

Comparing with Eq. (6.35) we get I = M R2

of the system is M.
(b)Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of
length of length l with a pair of small masses,
rotating about an axis through the centre of
mass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 6.28).
Each mass M/2 is at a distance l/2 from
the axis. The moment of inertia of the masses
is therefore given by
(M/2) (l/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2
Thus, for the pair of masses, rotating about
the axis thr ough the centr e of mass
perpendicular to the rod
I = Ml2 / 4
Table 6.1 simply gives the moment of inertia of
various familiar regular shaped bodies about
specific axes. (The derivations of these
expressions are beyond the scope of this
textbook and you will study them in higher
classes.)
As the mass of a body resists a change in its
state of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia
in linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of
inertia about a given axis of rotation resists achange in its rotational motion, it can be
regarded as a measure of rotational inertia of
the body; it is a measure of the way in which
different parts of the body are distributed at
different distances from the axis. Unlike the
mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a
fixed quantity but depends on distribution of
mass about the axis of rotation, and the
orientation and position of the axis of rotation
with respect to the body as a whole. As a
measure of the way in which the mass of a
rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to
the axis of rotation, we can define a new
parameter , the radius of gyration . It is r elated
to the moment of inertia and the total mass of
the body.
Notice from the Table 6.1 that in all
cases, we can write I = Mk2, where k has
the dimension of length. For a rod, about
the perpendicular axis at its midpoint,
i.e.2 212, k L=  = 12 k L . Similarly, k = R/2
for the cir cular disc about its diameter . The
length k is a geometric property of the body and
axis of rotation. It is called the radius of
gyration . The radius of gyration of a body
about an axis  may be defined as the distance
from the axis of a mass point whose mass is
equal to the mass of the whole body and whose
moment of inertia is equal to the moment of
inertia of the body about the axis.
Thus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body
depends on the mass of the body, its shape and
size; distribution of mass about the axis of
rotation, and the position and orientation of the
axis of rotation.
From the definition, Eq. (6.34), we can infer
that the dimensions of moments of inertia are
ML2 and its SI units are kg m2.
The property of this extremely important
quantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of
the body, has been put to a great practical use.
The machines, such as steam engine and the
automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational
motion have a disc with a large moment of
inertia, called a flywheel . Because of its large
moment of inertia, the flywheel resists the
sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the
vehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed
and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring
a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.

uumotion. This section is limited only to kinematics.
We shall tur n to dynamics in later sections.
We recall that for specifying the angular
displacement of the rotating body we take any
particle like P (Fig.6.29) of the body. Its angular
displacement θ in the plane it moves is the
angular displacement of the whole body; θ is
measured from a fixed direction in the plane of
motion of P , which we take to be the x′-axis,
chosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,
the axis of rotation is the z – axis and the plane
of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.
Fig. 6.29 also shows θ0, the angular
displacement at t = 0.
We also r ecall that the angular velocity is
the time rate of change of angular displacement,
ω = dθ/dt. Note since the axis of rotation is fixed,
there is no need to treat angular velocity as a
vector . Further , the angular acceleration, α =
dω/dt.
The kinematical quantities in rotational
motion, angular displacement ( θ), angular
velocity ( ω) and angular acceleration ( α)
respectively are analogous to kinematic
quantities in linear motion, displacement ( x),
velocity ( v) and acceleration ( a). We know the
kinematical equations of linear motion with
uniform (i.e. constant) acceleration:

where x0 = initial displacement and v0= initial

6.11 DYNAMICS OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
ABOUT A FIXED AXIS
Table 6.2 lists quantities associated with linear
motion and their analogues in rotational
motion. W e have alr eady compar ed kinematics
of the two motions. Also, we know that in
rotational motion moment of inertia and torque
play the same role as mass and force
respectively in linear motion. Given this we
should be able to guess what the other
analogues indicated in the table are. For
example, we know that in linear motion, work
done is given by F dx, in rotational motion about
a fixed axis it should be dτ θ, since we already
know the correspondence d dxθ→  and Fτ→.It is, however , necessary that these
correspondences are established on sound
dynamical considerations. This is what we now
turn to.
Before we begin, we note a simplification
that arises in the case of rotational motion
about a fixed axis . Since the axis is fixed, only
those components of torques, which are along
the direction of the fixed axis need to be
considered in our discussion. Only these
components can cause the body to rotate about
the axis. A component of the torque
perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to
turn the axis fr om its position. W e specifically
assume that there will arise necessary forces of
constraint to cancel the effect of the
perpendicular components of the (external)
torques, so that the fixed position of the axis
will be maintained. The perpendicular
components of the torques, therefore need not
be taken into account. This means that for our
calculation of torques on a rigid body:
(1)We need to consider only those for ces that
lie in planes perpendicular to the axis.
Forces which are parallel to the axis will give
torques perpendicular to the axis and need
not be taken into account.
(2)We need to consider only those components
of the position vectors which are
perpendicular to the axis. Components of
position vectors along the axis will result in
torques perpendicular to the axis and need
not be taken into account.

SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 119
Figure 6.30 shows a cross-section of a rigid
body rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken
as the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the
page; see Fig. 6.29). As said above we need to
consider only those forces which lie in planes
perpendicular to the axis. Let F1 be one such
typical force acting as shown on a particle of
the body at point P1 with its line of action in a
plane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience
we call  this to be the x′–y′ plane (coincident
with the plane of the page). The particle at P1
describes a circular path of radius r1 with centre
C on the axis; CP1 = r1.
In time ∆t, the point moves to the position
P1′. The displacement of the particle ds1,
therefore, has magnitude d s1 = r1dθ and
direction tangential at P1 to the circular path
as shown. Here d θ is the angular displacement
of the particle, d θ = 1 1P CP∠′.The work done by
the force on the particle is
dW1 = F1. ds1= F1ds1 cosφ1= F1(r1 dθ)sinα1
where φ1 is the angle between F1 and the tangent
at P1, and α1 is the angle between  F1 and the
radius vector OP1; φ1 + α1 = 90 °.
The torque due to F1 about the origin is
OP1 × F1. Now OP1 = OC + OP1. [Refer to
Fig. 6.17(b). ] Since OC is along the axis, the torque
resulting from it is excluded from our
consideration. The effective torque due to F1 is
τ ττ ττ1= CP × F1; it is directed along the axis of rotation
and has a magnitude τ1= r1F1 sinα , Therefore,
dW1 = τ1dθIf there are more than one forces acting on
the body, the work done by all of them can be
added to give the total work done on the body.

the different forces as τ1, τ2, …  etc,

Remember , the for ces giving rise to the
torques act on different particles, but the
angular displacement d θ is the same for all
particles. Since all the torques considered are
parallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude τ of the
total torque is just the algebraic sum of the
magnitudes of the torques, i.e., τ = τ1 + τ2 + .....
We, ther efore, have
d dWτ θ= (6.39)
This expression gives the work done by the
total (external) torque τ which acts on the body
rotating about a fixed axis. Its similarity with
the corresponding expression
dW= F ds
for linear (translational) motion is obvious.

6.12 ANGULAR MOMENTUM IN CASE OF
ROTATION ABOUT A FIXED AXIS
We have studied in section 6.7, the angular
momentum of a system of particles. W e already
know from there that the time rate of total
angular momentum of a system of particles
about a point is equal to the total external torque
on the system taken about the same point. When
the total external torque is zero, the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved.
We now wish to study the angular momentum
in the special case of rotation about a fixed axis.
The general expression for the total angular
momentum of the system of n particles is
L r p= ×
=∑ i i
iN
1(6.25b)
We first consider the angular momentum of
a typical particle of the r otating rigid body. W e
then sum up the contributions of individual
particles to get L of the whole body.
For a typical particle l = r × p. As seen in the
last section r = OP = OC + CP  [Fig. 6.17(b)]. With
p = m v ,
( )( ) = × + ×OC v CP v m m l
The magnitude of the linear velocity v of the
particle at P is given by v = ωr⊥ where r⊥ is the
length of CP or the perpendicular distance of P
from the axis of r otation. Further , v is tangential
at P to the circle which the particle describes.
Using the right-hand rule one can check that
CP × v is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit
vector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z-axis)
is ˆk. Hence
()ˆ
⊥× =CP v k m r mv
= 2ˆ ω⊥k mr (since υ = ωr⊥ )
Similarly, we can check that OC × v is
perpendicular to the fixed axis. Let us denote
the part of  l along the fixed axis (i.e. the z-axis)
by lz, then
 z= ×CP v m l = 2ˆω⊥k mr
and = + × OC vz m l l
We note that lz is parallel to the fixed axis,
but l is not. In general, for a particle, the angular
momentum l is not along the axis of rotation,
i.e. for a particle, l and ω ωω ωω are not necessarily
parallel. Compare this with the corresponding
fact in translation. For a particle, p and v are
always parallel to each other .For computing the total angular momentum
of the whole rigid body, we add up the
contribution of each particle of the body.
Thus
We denote by ⊥L and zL the components of
L respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and
along the z-axis;
L OC v⊥= ×∑ i i im (6.42a)
where mi and vi are respectively the mass and
the velocity of the ith particle and Ci is the centre
of the circle described by the particle;
and
or ˆω=L kzI (6.42b)
The last step follows since the perpendicular
distance of the ith particle from the axis is ri; and
by definition the moment of inertia of the body
about the axis of rotation is I m ri i=∑2.
Notez ⊥ = +L L L (6.42c)
The rigid bodies which we have mainly
consider ed in this chapter ar e symmetric about
the axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is
one of their symmetry axes. For such bodies, for
a given OCi, for every particle which has a
velocity vi , ther e is another particle of velocity
–vi  located diametrically opposite on the cir cle
with centr e Ci described by the particle. T ogether
such pairs will contribute zer o to ⊥L and as a
result for symmetric bodies ⊥L is zer o, and
hence
ˆω = =L L kzI (6.42d)
For bodies, which are not symmetric about
the axis of rotation, L is not equal to Lz and hence
L does not lie along the axis of rotation.
Referring to Table 6.1, can you tell in which
cases L = Lz will not apply?
Let us differentiate Eq. (6.42b). Since ˆkis a
fixed (constant) vector , we get

As we have seen in the last section, only
those components of the external torques which
are along the axis of rotation, need to be taken
into account, when we discuss rotation about a
fixed axis. This means we can take ˆτ=kτ .
Since z ⊥ = +L L L  and the direction of Lz (vector
ˆk) is fixed, it follows that for rotation about a
fixed axis,
dˆ
dτ=Lkz
t(6.43a)
and d0dt⊥=L(6.43b)
Thus, for rotation about a fixed axis, the
component of angular momentum perpendicular
to the fixed axis is constant. As ˆω=L kzI, we
get from Eq. (6.43a),
()d
dItω τ= (6.43c)
If the moment of inertia I does not change with
time,
()d d
d dI I It tωω α= =
and we get from Eq. (6.43c),
Iτ α= (6.41)We have alr eady derived this equation using
the work - kinetic energy route.
6.12.1  Conservation of angular momentum
We are now in a position to r evisit the principle
of conservation of angular momentum in the
context of rotation about a fixed axis. From Eq.
(6.43c), if the external torque is zero,
Lz = Iω = constant (6.44)
For symmetric bodies, from Eq. (6.42d), Lz
may be replaced by L .(L and Lz  are respectively
the magnitudes of L and Lz.)
This then is the required form, for fixed axis
rotation, of Eq. (6.29a), which expresses the
general law of conservation of angular momentum
of a system of particles.  Eq. (6.44) applies to many
situations that we come acr oss in daily life.  Y ou

stretch your arms horizontally.  What happens?
Your angular speed is r educed.  If you bring back

SUMMARY
1.Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the
body do not change, even though there are forces on them.
2.A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid
body not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination
of translational and rotational motions.
3.In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which
lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in
the rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.
4.In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any
instant of time.
5.Angular velocity is a vector . Its magnitude is ω = dθ/dt and it is dir ected along the axis
of rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ω ωω ωω has a fixed direction.
6.The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The
magnitude of this vector is absin θ  and its direction is given by the right handed screw
or the right hand rule.
7.The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by
v = ω ωω ωω × r, wher e r is the position vector of the particle with r espect to an origin along the
fixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one
point fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed
point taken as the origin.
8.The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position
vector is
Rr
=∑m
Mii
9.Velocity of the centr e of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, wher e P is the
linear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the
system is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total
external force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is
constant.
10.The angular momentum of a system of n particles about the origin is
L r p  
  = ×
=∑ i
in
i

The torque or moment of force on a system of n particles about the origin is
= ×∑r Fi i
1τ
The force  Fi  acting on the ith particle includes the external as well as internal forces.
Assuming Newton’s third law of motion and that forces between any two particles act
along the line joining the particles, we can show τ ττ ττint = 0 andmechanism is neglected, there is no external
torque about the axis of rotation of the chair and
hence Iω is constant.  Stretching the arms
increases I about the axis of rotation, resulting in
decreasing the angular speed ω.  Bringing the
arms closer to the body has the opposite effect.A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage
of this principle.  Also, skaters and classical,
Indian or western, dancers performing a
pirouette (a spinning about a tip–top) on the toes
of one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.
Can you explain?

POINTS TO PONDER
1.To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal
forces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external
forces on the body.
2.Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,
the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of
mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One
example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as
the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of the
centre of mass MV2/2,
      K = K′ + MV2/2
3.Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s
Second Law and also Newton’s Thir d Law for particles.
4.To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of
particles is the total exter nal tor que in the system, we need not only Newton’s second
law for particles, but also Newton’s thir d law with the pr ovision that the for ces between
any two particles act along the line joining the particles.
5.The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque
are independent conditions. W e can have one without the other . In a couple, total
external force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.
6.The total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is
zero.
7.The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational
field does not vary fr om one part of the body to the other .d
dtextL=τ τ
11.A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if
(1)it is in translational equilibrium, i.e., the total external force on it is zero : F 0i=∑ ,
and
(2)it is in rotational equilibrium, i.e. the total external torque on it is zero :
τ τi i i= × =∑ ∑ r F 0 .
12.The centre of gravity of an extended body is that point where the total gravitational
torque on the body is zero.
13.The moment of intertia of a rigid body about an axis is defined by the formula  I m ri i=∑2
where ri is the perpendicular distance of the ith point of the body from the axis. The

6.14 To maintain a rotor at a uniform angular speed of 200 rad s -1, an engine needs to
transmit a tor que of 180 N m. What is the power r equir ed by the engine ?
(Note: uniform angular velocity in the absence of friction implies zero torque. In
practice, applied torque is needed to counter frictional torque). Assume that the
engine is 100% efficient.
6.15 From a uniform disk of radius R, a circular hole of radius R/2 is cut out. The centre
of the hole is at R/2 from the centr e of the original disc. Locate the centr e of gravity
of the resulting flat body.
6.16 A metre stick is balanced on a knife edge at its centre. When two coins, each of mass
5 g are put one on top of the other at the 12.0 cm mark, the stick is found to be
balanced at 45.0 cm. What is the mass of the metre stick?
6.17 The oxygen molecule has a mass of 5.30 × 10-26 kg and a moment of inertia of
1.94 ×10-46 kg m2 about an axis through its centre perpendicular to the lines joining
the two atoms. Suppose the mean speed of such a molecule in a gas is 500 m/s and
that its kinetic energy of rotation is two thirds of its kinetic energy of translation.
Find the average angular velocity of the molecule.
