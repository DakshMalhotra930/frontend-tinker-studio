In the pr evious chapter , we have lear nt that in every atom, the positive
charge and mass are densely concentrated at the centre of the atom
forming its nucleus. The overall dimensions of a nucleus are much smaller
than those of an atom. Experiments on scattering of a-particles
demonstrated that the radius of a nucleus was smaller than the radius
of an atom by a factor of about 104. This means the volume of a nucleus
is about 10–12 times the volume of the atom. In other words, an atom is
almost empty. If an atom is enlarged to the size of a classroom, the nucleus
would be of the size of pinhead. Nevertheless, the nucleus contains most
(more than 99.9%) of the mass of an atom.
Does the nucleus have a structure, just as the atom does?  If so, what
are the constituents of the nucleu s?  How are these held togethe r? In this
chapter , we shall look for answers to such questions. W e shall discuss
various properties of nuclei such as their size, mass and stability, and
also associated nuclear phenomena such as radioactivity, fission and fusion.
13.2  A TOMIC MASSES AND COMPOSITION  OF NUCLEUS
The mass of an atom is very small, compared to a kilogram;  for example,
the mass of a carbon atom, 12C, is 1.992647 × 10–26 kg. Kilogram is not
a very convenient unit to measure such small quantities. Therefore, aChapter Thirteen

different mass unit is used for expressing atomic masses. This unit is the
atomic mass unit (u), defined as 1/12th of the mass of the carbon (12C)
atom . According to this definition

     271.660539 10 kg−= × (13.1)
The atomic masses of various elements expressed in atomic mass
unit (u) are close to being integral multiples of the mass of a hydrogen
atom. Ther e are, however , many striking exceptions to this rule. For
example, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u.
Accurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass
spectr ometer , The measur ement of atomic masses r eveals the existence
of different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same
chemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same
element differing in mass are called isotopes . (In Greek, isotope means
the same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of
elements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture
of several isotopes.  The relative abundance of different isotopes differs
from element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having
masses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the
mass of a hydrogen atom.  The relative abundances of these isotopes are
75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively.  Thus, the average mass of a chlorine
atom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two
isotopes,  which works out to be
= 75.4 34.98 24.6 36.98
100× + ×
=  35.47 u
which agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine.
Even the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses
1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u.  The nucleus of the lightest atom of
hydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the
proton.  The mass of a proton is
271.00727 u 1.67262 10 kgpm−= = × (13.2)
This is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1.00783u), minus
the mass of a single electron ( me = 0.00055 u).  The other two isotopes of
hydrogen ar e called deuterium and tritium. T ritium nuclei, being
unstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in
laboratories.
The positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton
carries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought
that the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using
arguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are
outside the nucleus. W e know that the number of these electr ons outside
the nucleus of the atom is Z, the atomic number . The total char ge of the
Reprint 2025-26

308atomic electrons is thus (– Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge
of the nucleus is (+ Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom
is, ther efore, exactly Z, the atomic number .
Discovery of Neutron
Since the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they
must contain only one proton each.  But the masses of the nuclei of
hydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3.  Therefore, the
nuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain,  in addition to a proton,
some neutral matter .  The amount of neutral matter pr esent in the nuclei
of these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately
equal to one and two, respectively.  This fact indicates that the nuclei of
atoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a
basic unit.  This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick
who observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were
bombarded with alpha-particles ( a-particles are helium nuclei, to be
discussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation
could knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon
and nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons
(electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation
of energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted
of photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is
available from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with a-particles.
The clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to
assume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral
particles called neutrons .  From conservation of energy and momentum,
he was able to determine the mass of new particle ‘as very nearly the
same as mass of proton’.
The mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is
mn = 1.00866 u = 1.6749×10–27 kg (13.3)
Chadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his
discovery of the neutron.
A free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable.  It decays into a
proton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and
has a mean life of about 1000s.  It is, however , stable inside the nucleus.
The composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following
terms and symbols:
Z - atomic number  = number of protons [13.4(a)]
N - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)]
A - mass number  = Z + N
                              = total number of protons and neutrons [13.4(c)]
One also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the
number of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A.
Nuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation XA
Z where X  is
the chemical symbol of the species.  For example, the nucleus of gold is
denoted by 197
79Au.  It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons
and the rest118 are neutrons.

The composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily
explained.  The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same
number of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons.
Deuterium, 2
1H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton
and one neutron.  Its other isotope tritium, 3
1H, contains one proton and
two neutrons.  The element gold has 32 isotopes, ranging from A =173 to
A = 204.  W e have alr eady mentioned that chemical pr operties of elements
depend on their electronic structure.  As the atoms of isotopes have
identical electronic structure they have identical chemical behaviour and
are placed in the same location in the periodic table.
All nuclides with same mass number A are called isobars .  For
example, the nuclides 3
1H and 3
2He are isobars.  Nuclides with same
neutron number N but different atomic number Z, for example 198
80Hg
and 197
79Au, are called isotones .
13.3  S IZE OF THE NUCLEUS
As we have seen in Chapter 12, Rutherford was the pioneer who
postulated and established the existence of the atomic nucleus. At
Rutherford’s suggestion, Geiger and Marsden performed their classic
experiment: on the scattering of a-particles from thin gold foils. Their
experiments revealed that the distance of closest approach to a gold
nucleus of an a-particle of kinetic energy 5.5 MeV is about 4.0 × 10–14 m.
The scattering of a-particle by the gold sheet could be understood by
Rutherford by assuming that the coulomb repulsive force was solely
responsible for scattering. Since the positive charge is confined to the
nucleus, the actual size of the nucleus has to be less than 4.0 × 10–14 m.
If we use a-particles of higher energies than 5.5 MeV, the distance of
closest approach to the gold nucleus will be smaller and at some point
the scattering will begin to be affected by the short range nuclear forces,
and differ from Rutherford’s calculations. Rutherford’s calculations are
based on pure coulomb repulsion between the positive charges of the a-
particle and the gold nucleus. From the distance at which deviations set
in, nuclear sizes can be inferred.
By performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead
of a-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various
elements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately
measured.
It has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius
R = R0 A1/3(13.5)
where R0 = 1.2 × 10–15 m (=1.2 fm; 1 fm = 10–15 m). This means the volume
of the nucleus, which is proportional to R3 is proportional to A. Thus the
density of nucleus is a constant, independent of A,  for all nuclei. Different
nuclei are like a drop of liquid of constant density. The density of nuclear
matter is approximately 2.3 × 1017 kg m–3. This density is very large
compar ed to or dinary matter , say water , which is 103 kg m–3. This is
understandable, as we have already seen that most of the atom is empty.
Ordinary matter consisting of atoms has a large amount of empty space.

has been compressed to such an extent that they resemble a big nucleus .
13.4  M ASS-ENERGY  
AND NUCLEAR  BINDING  ENERGY
13.4.1  Mass – Energy
Einstein showed from his theory of special relativity that it is necessary
to treat mass as another form of energy. Before the advent of this theory
of special relativity it was presumed  that mass and energy were conserved
separately in a r eaction. However , Einstein showed that mass is another
form of energy and one can convert mass-energy into other forms of
energy, say kinetic energy and vice-versa.
Einstein gave the famous mass-energy equivalence relation
E = mc2(13.6)
Here the energy equivalent of mass m is related by the above equation
and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and is approximately equal to
3×108 m s–1.
Example 13.2 Calculate the energy equivalent of 1 g of substance.
Solution
Energy, E = 10–3  × ( 3 × 108)2 J
     E = 10–3 × 9 × 1016 = 9 × 1013 J
Thus, if one gram of matter is converted to energy, there is a release
of enormous amount of energy.
Experimental verification of the Einstein’s mass-energy relation has
been achieved in the study of nuclear reactions amongst nucleons, nuclei,
electrons and other more recently discovered particles. In a reaction the
conservation law of energy states that the initial energy and the final
energy are equal provided the energy associated with mass is also
included. This concept is important in understanding nuclear masses
and the interaction of nuclei with one another . They for m the subject
matter of the next few sections.
13.4.2  Nuclear binding energy
In Section 13.2 we have seen that the nucleus is made up of neutrons
and protons.  Therefore it may be expected that the mass of the nucleus
is equal to the total mass of its individual pr otons and neutr ons.  However , EXAMPLE  13.1
Reprint 2025-26
311Nuclei EXAMPLE  13.3the nuclear mass M is found to be always less than this .  For example, let
us consider 16
8O; a nucleus which has 8 neutr ons and 8 pr otons.  W e
have
Mass of 8 neutrons = 8 × 1.00866 u
Mass of 8 protons   = 8 × 1.00727 u
Mass of 8 electrons = 8 × 0.00055 u
Therefore the expected mass of 16
8O nucleus
= 8 × 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u.
The atomic mass of 16
8O found from mass spectroscopy experiments
is seen to be 15.99493  u. Substracting the mass of 8 electrons (8 × 0.00055 u)
from this, we get the experimental mass of 16
8O nucleus to be 15.99053 u.
Thus, we find that the mass of the 16
8O nucleus is less than the total
mass of its constituents by 0.13691u. The difference in mass of a nucleus
and its constituents, ∆M, is called the mass defect , and is given by
[ ( ) ]p n M Zm A Z m MΔ = + − − (13.7)
What is the meaning of the mass defec t? It is here that Einstein’s
equivalence  of mass and energy plays a role. Since the mass of the oxygen
nucleus is less that the sum of the masses of its constituents (8 protons
and 8 neutrons, in the unbound state), the equivalent energy of the oxygen
nucleus is less than that of the sum of the equivalent energies of its
constituents. If one wants to break the oxygen nucleus into 8 protons
and 8 neutrons, this extra energy ∆ M c2, has to be supplied. This energy
required Eb is related to the mass defect by
Eb = ∆ M c2(13.8)
Example 13.3   Find the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit,
first in Joules and then in MeV .  Using this, expr ess the mass defect
of 16
8O in MeV/ c2.
Solution
1u = 1.6605 × 10–27 kg
To convert it into energy units, we multiply it by c2 and find that
energy equivalent = 1.6605 × 10–27 × (2.9979 × 108)2 kg m2/s2

For 16
8O,   ∆M = 0.13691 u = 0.13691×931.5 MeV/ c2
= 127.5 MeV/ c2
The energy needed to separate 16
8O into its constituents is thus
127.5 MeV/ c2.
If a certain number of neutrons and protons are brought together to
form a nucleus of a certain charge and mass, an energy Eb will be released

312in the process.  The energy Eb is called the binding energy  of the nucleus.
If we separate a nucleus into its nucleons, we would have to supply a
total energy equal to Eb, to those particles.  Although we cannot tear
apart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding energy is still a convenient
measur e of how well a nucleus is held together .  A mor e useful measur e
of the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the binding
energy per nucleon , Ebn, which is the ratio of the binding energy Eb of a
nucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus:
Ebn   =  Eb / A (13.9)
We can think of binding ener gy per nucleon as the average ener gy
per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.
Figure 13.1 is a plot of the
binding energy per nucleon Ebn
versus the mass number A for a
large number of nuclei. W e notice
the following main features of
the plot:
(i)the binding energy per
nucleon, Ebn, is practically
constant, i.e. practically
independent of the atomic
number for nuclei of middle
mass number ( 30 < A < 170).
The curve has a maximum of
about 8.75 MeV for A = 56
and has a value of 7.6 MeV
for A = 238.
(ii)Ebn is lower for both light
nuclei ( A<30) and heavy
nuclei ( A>170).
We can draw some conclusions fr om these two observations:
(i)The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding
energy of a few MeV per nucleon.
(ii)The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a
consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider
a particular nucleon inside a sufficiently large nucleus. It will be under
the influence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the
range of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more
than the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will
have no influence on the binding energy of the nucleon under
consideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours
within the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be
proportional to p. Let the binding energy of the nucleus be pk, where
k is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase A by
adding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon
inside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it
and not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon
would be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is
approximately equal to pk. The property that a given nucleonFIGURE  13.1  The binding energy per nucleon
as a function of mass number .
Reprint 2025-26
313Nuclei
influences only nucleons close to it is also referred to as saturation
property of the nuclear force.
(iii)A very heavy nucleus, say A = 240, has lower binding energy per
nucleon compared to that of a  nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a
nucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more
tightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process.
It has very important implications for energy production through
fission , to be discussed later in Section 13.7.1.
(iv)Consider two very light nuclei ( A≤10) joining to form a heavier
nucleus. The binding energy  per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei
is more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei.
This means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial
system. Again energy would be released in such a process of
fusion . This is the energy source of sun, to be discussed later in
Section 13.7.2.
13.5  N UCLEAR  FORCE
The force that determines the motion of atomic electrons is the familiar
Coulomb force. In Section 13.4,  we have seen that for average mass
nuclei the binding energy per nucleon is  approximately 8 MeV, which is
much larger than the binding energy in atoms. Therefore, to bind a
nucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally
different kind. It must be strong enough to overcome the repulsion
between the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and
neutr ons into the tiny nuclear volume. W e have alr eady seen
that the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be
understood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the
nuclear binding force are summarised below. These are
obtained from a variety of experiments carried out during 1930
to 1950.
(i)The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force
acting between charges or the gravitational forces between
masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over
the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the
nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is
much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational
force is much weaker  than even Coulomb force.
(ii)The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to
zero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This
leads to saturation of forces  in a medium or a large-sized
nucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the
binding energy per nucleon.
A rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons
as a function of distance is shown in the Fig. 13.2. The
potential energy is a minimum at a distance r0 of about
0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger
than 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less
than 0.8 fm.FIGURE  13.2 Potential energy
of a pair of nucleons as a
function of their separation.
For a separation greater
than r0, the force is attractive
and for separations less
than r0, the force is
strongly repulsive.

314(iii)The nuclear force between neutron-neutron, proton-neutron and
proton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not
depend on the electric charge.
Unlike Coulomb’s law or the Newton’s law of gravitation there is no
simple mathematical form of the nuclear force.
13.6  R ADIOACTIVITY
A. H. Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 purely by accident.  While
studying the fluorescence and phosphorescence of compounds irradiated
with visible light, Becquerel observed an interesting phenomenon.  After
illuminating some pieces of uranium-potassium sulphate with visible
light, he wrapped them in black paper and separated the package from a
photographic plate by a piece of silver .  When, after several hours of
exposure, the photographic plate was developed, it showed blackening
due to something that must have been emitted by the compound and
was able to penetrate both black paper and the silver .
Experiments performed subsequently showed that radioactivity was
a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes a decay.
This is referred to as radioactive decay . Three types of radioactive decay
occur in nature :
(i)a-decay in which a helium nucleus 4
2He is emitted;
(ii)b-decay in which electrons or positrons (particles with the same mass
as electrons, but with a charge exactly opposite to that of electron)
are emitted;
(iii)g-decay in which high energy (hundreds of keV or more) photons are
emitted.
13.7  N UCLEAR E NERGY
The curve of binding energy per nucleon Ebn, given in Fig. 13.1, has
a long flat middle region between A = 30 and A = 170. In this region
the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant (8.0 MeV). For
the lighter nuclei region, A < 30, and for the heavier nuclei region,
A > 170, the binding energy per nucleon is less than 8.0 MeV, as we
have noted earlier . Now, the gr eater the binding ener gy, the less is the
total mass of a bound system, such as a nucleus. Consequently, if nuclei
with less total binding energy transform to nuclei with greater binding
energy, there will be a net energy release. This is what happens when a
heavy nucleus decays into two or more intermediate mass fragments
(fission ) or when light nuclei fuse into a havier nucleus ( fusion .)
Exothermic chemical reactions underlie conventional energy sources
such as coal or petroleum. Here the energies involved are in the range of
electron volts. On the other hand,  in a nuclear reaction, the energy release
is of the or der of MeV . Thus for the same quantity of matter , nuclear
sources produce a million times more energy than a chemical source.
Fission of 1 kg of uranium, for example, generates 1014 J of energy;
compare it with burning of 1 kg of coal that gives 107 J.

13.7.1  Fission
New possibilities emerge when we go beyond natural radioactive decays
and study nuclear reactions by bombarding nuclei with other nuclear
particles such as proton, neutron, a-particle, etc.
A most important neutron-induced nuclear reaction is fission. An
example of fission is when a uranium isotope 235
92U bombarded with a
neutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments

Or, as another example,

0 92 54 38 0n U Xe Sr 2 n+ → + + (13.12)
The fragment products are radioactive nuclei; they emit b particles in
succession to achieve stable end products.
The energy released (the Q value ) in the fission reaction of nuclei like
uranium is of the order of 200 MeV per fissioning nucleus. This is
estimated as follows:
Let us take a nucleus with A = 240 breaking into two fragments each
of A = 120. Then
Ebn for A = 240 nucleus is about 7.6 MeV,
Ebn for the two A = 120 fragment nuclei is about 8.5 MeV .
\Gain in binding ener gy for nucleon is about 0.9 MeV .
Hence the total gain in binding ener gy is 240×0.9 or 216 MeV .
The disintegration energy in fission events first appears as the kinetic
energy of the fragments and neutrons. Eventually it is transferred to the
surrounding matter appearing as heat. The source of energy in nuclear
reactors, which produce electricity, is nuclear fission. The enormous
energy released in an atom bomb comes from uncontrolled nuclear
fission.
13.7.2  Nuclear fusion – energy generation in stars
When two light nuclei fuse to form a larger nucleus, energy is released,
since the larger nucleus is more tightly bound, as seen from the binding
energy curve in Fig.13.1. Some examples of such energy liberating nuclear
fusion reactions are :
1 1 2
1 1 1H H H+ → + e+ + n + 0.42 MeV [13.13(a)]
2 2 3
1 1 2H H He+ → + n + 3.27 MeV [13.13(b)]
2 2 3 1
1 1 1 1H H H H+ → + + 4.03 MeV [13.13(c)]
In the first reaction, two protons combine to form a deuteron and
a positron with a release of 0.42 MeV energy. In reaction [13.13(b)], two
Reprint 2025-26
Physics
316deuterons combine to form the light isotope of helium. In reaction
(13.13c), two deuterons combine to form a triton and a proton. For
fusion to take place, the two nuclei must come close enough so that
attractive short-range nuclear for ce is able to af fect them. However ,
since they are both positively charged particles, they experience coulomb
repulsion. They, therefore, must have enough energy to overcome this
coulomb barrier . The height of the barrier depends on the char ges and
radii of the two interacting nuclei. It can be shown, for example, that
the barrier height for two protons is ~ 400 keV, and is higher for nuclei
with higher char ges. W e can estimate the temperatur e at which two
protons in a proton gas would (averagely) have enough energy to
overcome the coulomb barrier:
(3/2) k T = K ≃ 400 keV, which gives T ~ 3 × 109 K.
When fusion is achieved by raising the temperature of the system so
that particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome the coulomb
repulsive behaviour , it is called thermonuclear fusion .
Thermonuclear fusion is the source of energy output in the interior
of stars. The interior of the sun has a temperature of 1.5×107 K, which
is considerably less than the estimated temperature required for fusion
of particles of average energy. Clearly, fusion in the sun involves protons
whose energies are much above the average energy.
The fusion reaction in the sun is a multi-step process in which the
hydrogen is burned into helium. Thus, the fuel in the sun is the hydrogen
in its core. 
The proton-proton  (p, p) cycle by which this  occurs is
represented by the following sets of reactions:
1 1 2
1 1 1H H H+ → + e+ + n + 0.42 MeV (i)

Thus, four hydrogen atoms combine to form an 4
2He atom with a
release of 26.7 MeV of energy.
Helium is not the only element that can be synthesized in the interior of
a star . As the hydr ogen in the cor e gets depleted and becomes  helium, the
core starts to cool. The star begins to collapse under its own gravity which
increases the temperature of the core. If this temperature increases to about
108 K, fusion takes place again, this time of helium nuclei into carbon.
This kind of process can generate through fusion higher and higher mass
number elements. But elements more massive than those near the peak of
the binding energy curve in Fig. 13.1 cannot be so produced.

The age of the sun is about 5×109 y and it is estimated that there is
enough hydrogen in the sun to keep it going for another 5 billion years.
After that, the hydrogen burning will stop and the sun will begin to cool
and will start to collapse under gravity, which will raise the core
temperature. The outer envelope of the sun will expand, turning it into
the so called red giant .
13.7.3  Controlled thermonuclear fusion
The natural thermonuclear fusion process in a star is replicated in a
thermonuclear fusion device. In controlled fusion reactors, the aim is to
generate steady power by heating the nuclear fuel to a temperature in the
range of 108 K. At these temperatures, the fuel is a mixture of positive
ions and electrons (plasma). The challenge is to confine this plasma, since
no container can stand such a high temperature. Several countries
around the world including India are developing techniques in this
connection. If successful, fusion reactors will hopefully supply almost
unlimited power to humanity.
Example 13.4 Answer the following questions:
(a)Are the equations of nuclear reactions (such as those given in
Section 13.7) ‘balanced’ in the sense a chemical equation (e.g.,
2H2 + O2® 2 H2O)  is? If not, in what sense are they balanced on
both side s?
(b)If both the number of protons and the number of neutrons are
conserved in each nuclear reaction, in what way is mass converted
into energy (or vice-versa) in a nuclear reaction?
(c)A general impression exists that  mass-energy interconversion
takes place only in nuclear reaction and never in chemical
reaction. This is strictly speaking, incorrect. Explain.
Solution
(a)A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of
atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.
A chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of
atoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus,
the number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved
in a nuclear r eaction. However , the number of pr otons and the
number of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear
reaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of
very high energies – what is strictly conserved is the total charge
and total ‘baryon number’. W e need not pursue this matter her e.]
In nuclear reactions (e.g., Eq. 13.10), the number of protons and
the number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation.
(b)We know that the binding ener gy of a nucleus gives a negative
contribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since
proton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear
reaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same
on either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei
on the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand
side. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy
released or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy EXAMPLE  13.4
Reprint 2025-26
Physics
318
 EXAMPLE  13.4contributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass
of nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa.
It is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass-
energy interconversion.
(c)From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical
reaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle.  The energy
released or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the
difference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms
and molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly
speaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative
contribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule,
we can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of
atoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction
gets converted into ener gy or vice-versa. However , the mass
defects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times
smaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for
the general impression, (which is incorrec t) that mass-energy
interconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction.
SUMMARY
1.An atom has a nucleus. The nucleus is positively charged. The radius
of the nucleus is smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of
104. More than 99.9% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.
2.On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u). By
definition, 1 atomic mass unit (1u) is 1/12th mass of one atom of 12C;
1u = 1.660563 × 10–27 kg.
3.A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost
the same as that of proton
4.The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus
of an element. The mass number A is the total number of protons and
neutrons in the atomic nucleus; A = Z+N ; Here N denotes the number
of neutrons in the nucleus.
A nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as  XA
Z, where X is the
chemical symbol of the species.
Nuclides with the same atomic number Z, but different neutron number
N are called isotopes . Nuclides with the same A are isobars  and those
with the same N are isotones .
Most elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass
of an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes and
calculated in accordance to the relative abundances of the isotopes.
5.A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a
radius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the
nuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula
R = R0 A1/3,
where R0 = a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density
is independent of A. It is of the order of 1017 kg/m3.
6.Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short-range strong
nuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron
and proton.

7.The nuclear mass M is always less than the total mass, Sm, of its
constituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents
is called the mass defect ,
DM = (Z mp + (A – Z)mn) – M
Using Einstein’s mass energy relation, we express this mass difference
in terms of energy as
DEb = DM c2
The energy DEb represents the binding energy  of the nucleus. In the
mass number range A = 30 to 170, the binding energy per nucleon is
nearly constant, about 8 MeV/nucleon.
8.Energies associated with nuclear processes are about a million times
larger than chemical process.
9.The Q-value of a nuclear process is
      Q = final kinetic energy – initial kinetic energy.
Due to conservation of mass-energy, this is also,
Q = (sum of initial masses – sum of final masses) c2
10.Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which nuclei of a given species
transform by giving out a or b or g rays; a-rays are helium nuclei;
b-rays are electrons. g-rays are electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths
shorter than X-rays.
11.Energy is released when less tightly bound nuclei are transmuted into
more tightly bound nuclei. In fission, a heavy nucleus like 235
92U breaks
into two smaller fragments, e.g., 235 1 133 99 1
92 0 51 41 0 U+ n Sb Nb + 4 n→ +
12.In fusion, lighter nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus. Fusion of
hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei is the source of energy of all stars
including our sun.

320POINTS TO PONDER
1.The density of nuclear matter is independent of the size of the nucleus.
The mass density of the atom does not follow this rule.
2.The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to
be slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering.
This is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of
the nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear
matter .
3.After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = m c2,
we cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass
and conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of
conservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that
this principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is
central to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a
source of power . Using the principle, Q of a nuclear pr ocess (decay or
reaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses.
4.The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that
exothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse
or when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission into nuclei with intermediate
mass.
5.For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to
overcome the coulomb potential barrier . That is why fusion r equir es
very high temperatures.
6.Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly
varying, it shows peaks at nuclides like 4He, 16O etc. This is considered
as evidence of atom-like shell structure in nuclei.
7.Electr on and positr on ar e a particle-antiparticle pair . They ar e identical
in mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite. (It is
found that when an electr on and a positr on come together , they
annihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma-ray photons.)
8.Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability
requires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light
nuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. (More
neutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the
protons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei
which have an excess of neutrons  or protons are unstable. In fact,
only about 10% of knon isotopes (of all elements), are stable. Others
have been either artificially produced in the laboratory by bombarding
α, p, d, n or other particles on targets of stable nuclear species or
identified in astronomical observations of matter in the universe.
