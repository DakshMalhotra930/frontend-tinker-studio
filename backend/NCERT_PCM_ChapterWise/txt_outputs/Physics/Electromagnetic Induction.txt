1546.1  I NTRODUCTION
Electricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated
phenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century,
experiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others
established the fact that electricity and magnetism ar e inter -related. They
found that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,
an electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity.
This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible?
Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit
such a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is
resounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and
Joseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated
conclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when
subjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter , we will study the
phenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand
the underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is
generated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called
electromagnetic induction .
When Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion
between a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the
latter , he was asked, “What is the use of it?” His r eply was: “What is the
use of a new born baby?” The phenomenon of electromagnetic inductionChapter Six

of practical utility. Imagine a world where there is no
electricity – no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and
no personal computers. The pioneering experiments of
Faraday and Henry have led directly to the development
of modern day generators and transformers. Today’s
civilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the
discovery of electromagnetic induction.
6.2THE EXPERIMENTS  OF FARADA Y AND
HENRY
The discovery and understanding of electromagnetic
induction are based on a long series of experiments carried
out by Faraday and Henry. W e shall now describe some
of these experiments.
Experiment 6.1
Figure 6.1 shows a coil C1* connected to a galvanometer
G. When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed
towards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deflects,
indicating  the presence of electric  current in the coil. The
deflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion.
The galvanometer does not show any deflection when the
magnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled
away from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in
the opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the
current’s dir ection. Mor eover , when the South-pole of
the bar magnet is moved towards or away from the
coil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite
to that observed with the North-pole for similar
movements. Further , the deflection (and hence curr ent)
is found to be larger when the magnet is pushed
towar ds or pulled away fr om the coil faster . Instead,
when the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 is
moved towards or away from the magnet, the same
effects are observed. It shows that it is the relative
motion between the magnet and the coil that is
responsible for generation (induction) of electric
current in the coil .
Experiment 6.2
In Fig. 6.2 the bar magnet is replaced by a second coil
C2 connected to a battery. The steady current in the
coil C2 produces a steady magnetic field. As coil C2 is

156moved towards the coil C1, the galvanometer shows a
deflection. This indicates that electric current is induced in
coil C1. When C2 is moved away, the galvanometer shows a
deflection again, but this time in the opposite direction. The
deflection lasts as long as coil C2 is in motion. When the coil
C2 is held fixed and C1 is moved, the same effects are observed.
Again, it is the relative motion between the coils that induces
the electric current .
Experiment 6.3
The above two experiments involved relative motion between
a magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.
Through another experiment, Faraday showed that this
relative motion is not an absolute requirement. Figure 6.3
shows two coils C1 and C2 held stationary. Coil C1 is connected
to galvanometer G while the second coil C2 is connected to a
battery through a tapping key K.FIGURE  6.2  Current is
induced in coil C1 due to motion
of the current carrying coil C2.
FIGURE  6.3 Experimental set-up for Experiment 6.3.
It is observed that the galvanometer shows a momentary deflection
when the tapping key K is pressed. The pointer in the galvanometer returns
to zero immediately. If the key is held pressed continuously, there is no
deflection in the galvanometer . When the key is r eleased, a momentory
deflection is observed again, but in the opposite direction. It is also observed
that the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted
into the coils along their axis.
6.3  M AGNETIC  FLUX
Faraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation
to explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic
induction. However , befor e we state and appr eciate his laws, we must get
familiar with the notion of magnetic flux, F B. Magnetic flux is defined in
the same way as electric flux is defined in Chapter 1. Magnetic flux through

157a plane of area A placed in a uniform magnetic field B (Fig. 6.4) can
be written as
F B  = B . A = BA cos q (6.1)
where q   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector
has been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be
extended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.
If the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at
various parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic
flux through the surface is given by
1 1 2 2d d Φ= + +B A B A. .B... = B A.i id
all∑(6.2)
where ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dAi
comprising the surface and Bi is the magnetic field at the area element
dAi. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla meter
squared (T m2). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.
6.4  F ARADA Y’S LAW OF INDUCTION
From the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a
conclusion that an emf  is induced in a coil when magnetic flux
through the coil changes with time. Experimental observations
discussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.
The motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C1 in
Experiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards
or away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic
flux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux induces
emf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electric
curr
ent to flow in coil C1 and thr ough the galvanometer . A
plausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is
as follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in
coil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a
maximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic
flux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in
magnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.
When the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,
there is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current in
coil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the
resulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a
short time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C1
and hence again induces an electric current in coil C1*. The common
point in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic
flux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental
observations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic
induction . The law is stated below.FIGURE  6.4 A plane of
surface area A placed in a
uniform magnetic field B.

 EXAMPLE  6.1The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal
to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the
circuit.
Mathematically, the induced emf  is given by
d–dB
tΦε= (6.3)
The negative sign indicates the direction of e  and hence
the direction of current in a closed loop. This will be
discussed in detail in the next section.
In the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change
of flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,
the expression for the total induced emf is given by
d–dBNtΦε= (6.4)
The induced emf can be increased by increasing the
number of turns N of a closed coil.
From Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can be
varied by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and
q. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is
changed by varying B. The flux can also be altered by
changing the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or
stretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a
magnetic field such that the angle q  between B and A
changes. In these cases too, an emf is induced in the
respective coils.
Example 6.1  Consider Experiment 6.2. (a) What would you do to obtain
a large deflection of the galvanometer? (b) How would you demonstrate
the presence of an induced current in the absence of a galvanometer?
Solution
(a)To obtain a large deflection , one or more of the following steps can
be taken:  (i) Use a rod made of soft iron  inside the coil C2, (ii) Connect
the coil to a powerful battery, and (iii) M ove the arrangement rapidly
towards the test coil  C1.
(b)Replace the galvanometer by a small bulb, the kind one finds in a
small torch  light. The relative motion between the two coils will cause
the bulb to glow and thus demonstrate the presence of an induced
current.
In experimental physics one must learn to innovate. Michael Faraday
who is ranked as one of the best experimentalists ever , was legendary
for his innovative skills.

placed vertically in the east-west  plane. A uniform magnetic field of
0.10 T is set up across the plane in the north-east direction. The

the magnitudes of induced emf and current during this time-interval.Michael Faraday  [1791–

Note that the earth’s magnetic field also produces a flux through the
loop. But it is a steady field (which does not change within the time
span of the experiment) and hence does not induce any emf.
Example 6.3
A circular coil of radius 10 cm, 500 turns and resistance 2 W is placed
with its plane perpendicular to the horizontal component of the earth’s
magnetic field. It is rotated about its vertical diameter through 180°
in 0.25 s. Estimate the magnitudes of the emf and current induced in
the coil. Horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field at the
place is 3.0 × 10–5 T.
Solution
Initial flux through the coil,
FB (initial)= BA cos q
= 3.0 × 10–5 × (p ×10–2) × cos 0°
= 3p × 10–7 Wb
Final flux after the rotation,
FB (final)    = 3.0 × 10–5 × (p ×10–2) × cos 180°
= –3p  × 10–7 Wb
Therefore, estimated value of the induced emf is,

   = 500 × (6 p × 10–7)/0.25
   = 3.8  × 10–3  V

Note that the magnitudes of e and I are the estimated values. Their
instantaneous values are different and depend upon the speed of
rotation at the particular instant. EXAMPLE  6.3

1606.5  L ENZ’ S LAW AND C ONSER VATION OF ENERGY
In 1834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1804-1865) deduced
a rule, known as 
Lenz’s law which gives the polarity of the induced emf
in a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is:
The polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current
which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
The negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) repr esents this ef fect. W e can
understand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In
Fig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed
towards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards
the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is
induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.
This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter -clockwise
direction with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.
Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity
towards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-
pole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux
through the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,
the induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-
pole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in
an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the
corresponding decrease in flux.
What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop
in the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open
ends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found
using Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier
way to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the
direction shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced
currents.
A little reflection on this matter should convince us on the
correctness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in
the direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,
the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching
North-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted
towards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on
the magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy
will continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can
happen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a
suitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy
and hence can not happen.
Now consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,
the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced
current. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.
Where does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is
dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.FIGURE  6.6

Solution
(i)The magnetic flux through the rectangular loop abcd increases,
due to the motion of the loop into the region of magnetic field, The
induced current must flow along the path bcdab so that it opposes
the increasing flux.
(ii)Due to the outward motion, magnetic flux through the triangular
loop abc decreases due to which the induced current flows along
bacb, so as to oppose the change in flux.
(iii)As the magnetic flux decreases due to motion of the irregular
shaped loop abcd out of the region of magnetic field, the induced
current flows along cdabc, so as to oppose change in flux.
Note that there are no induced current as long as the loops are
completely inside or outside the region of the magnetic field.

Let us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-
independent magnetic field.  Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor
PQRS  in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved
towards the left with a constant velocity v  as
shown in the figure. Assume that there is no
loss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a
closed circuit enclosing an area that changes
as PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic
field B which is perpendicular to the plane of
this system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, the
magnetic flux FB enclosed  by the loop PQRS
will be
FB = Blx
Since x is changing with time, the rate of change
of flux FB will induce an emf given by:

Reprint 2025-26
Electromagnetic
Induction
163where we have used dx /dt = –v  which is the speed of the conductor PQ.
The induced emf Blv is called motional emf . Thus, we are able to produce
induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,
that is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.
It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)
by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor
PQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod
moves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed 
v in the
magnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,
and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in
magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ.
The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,
W = qvBl
Since emf is the work done per unit charge,
W
qε=
    = Blv
This equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical
to Eq. (6.5). W e stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But
it does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when
the conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent
magnetic field.
On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a
conductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact which
Faraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary
conductor , the for ce on its char ges is given by
F = q (E + v ´ ´´´´ B) = q
E (6.6)
since v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric
field term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or
induced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field
generates an electric field. However , we hasten to add that electric fields
produced by static electric charges have properties different from those
produced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that
charges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet.
Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing
magnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the
fundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and
magnetism are related.

 EXAMPLE  6.6FIGURE  6.11
Solution
Method I
As the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outer
end due to Lorentz force and get distributed over the ring. Thus, the
resulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of
the rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons
and a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the
emf generated across a length d r of the rod as it moves at right angles
to the magnetic field is given by

To calculate the emf, we can imagine a closed loop OPQ in which
point O and P are connected with a resistor R and OQ is the rotating
rod. The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the

6.7  I NDUCTANCE
An electric current can be induced in a coil by flux change produced by
another coil in its vicinity or flux change produced by the same coil. These
two situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.
However, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the
current. That is,  ΦB α I.
Further, if the geometry of the coil does not vary with time then,
d d
d dB I
t tΦ∝
For a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linked
with all the turns. When the flux ΦB through the coil changes, each turn
contributes to the induced emf. Therefore, a term called flux linkage  is
used which is equal to NΦB for a closely wound coil and in such a case
NΦB∝ I
The constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance .
We shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil
and intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which
for a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation
(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium
(intrinsic material property).
Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T–2 A–2]
given by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The
SI unit of inductance is henry  and is denoted by H. It is named in honour
of Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,
independently of Faraday in England.
6.7.1  Mutual inductance
Consider Fig. 6.12 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length
l. We denote the radius of the inner solenoid S1 by r1 and the number of
turns per unit length by n1. The corresponding quantities for the outer
solenoid S2 are r2 and n2, respectively. Let N1 and N2 be the total number
of turns of coils S1 and S2, respectively.
Reprint 2025-26

166When a current I2 is set up through S2, it in turn sets
up a magnetic flux through S1. Let us denote it by Φ1.
The corresponding flux linkage with  solenoid S1 is
N11 12 2M IΦ= (6.7)
M12 is called the mutual inductance  of solenoid S1 with
respect to solenoid S2. It is also referred to as the
coefficient of mutual induction .
For these simple co-axial solenoids it is possible to
calculate M12. The magnetic field due to the current I2 in
S2 is µ0n2I2. The resulting flux linkage with coil S1 is,

0 1 2 1 2n n r l Iµ= π (6.8)
where n1l is the total number of turns in solenoid S1.
Thus, from Eq. (6.7) and Eq. (6.8),
M12 = µ0n1n2πr2
1l (6.9)
Note that we neglected the edge effects and considered
the magnetic field µ0n2I2 to be uniform throughout the
length and width of the solenoid S2. This is a good approximation keeping
in mind that the solenoid is long, implying l  >> r2.
We now consider the reverse case. A current I1 is passed through the
solenoid S1 and the flux linkage with coil S2 is,
N2Φ2 = M21 I1(6.10)
M21 is called the mutual inductance  of solenoid S2 with respect to
solenoid S1.
The flux due to the current I1 in S1 can be assumed to be confined
solely inside S1 since the solenoids are very long. Thus, flux linkage with
solenoid S2 is
()()()2
2 2 2 1 0 1 1N n l r n IΦ µ = π
where n2l is the total number of turns of S2. From Eq. (6.10),
M21 = µ0n1n2πr2
1l (6.11)
Using Eq. (6.9) and Eq. (6.10), we get
M12 = M21= M (say) (6.12)
We have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.
However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid
was much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then
we could still have calculated the flux linkage N1Φ1 because the inner
solenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the
outer solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy. However,
it would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer
solenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across
the length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the
calculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case. The
equality M12=M21 is very useful in such situations.FIGURE  6.12 Two long co-axial

solenoids. Instead, if a medium of relative permeability µr had been present,
the mutual inductance would be

It is also important to know that the mutual inductance of a pair of
coils, solenoids, etc., depends on their separation as well as their relative
orientation.
Example  6.8 Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius r1 and
the other of large radius r2, such that r1 << r2,  are placed co-axially
with centres coinciding. Obtain the mutual inductance of the
arrangement.
Solution  Let a current I2 flow through the outer circular coil. The
field at the centre of the coil is B2 = µ0I2 / 2r2. Since the other
co-axially placed coil has a very small radius, B2 may be considered
constant over its cross-sectional area. Hence,

Note that we calculated M12 from an approximate value of Φ1, assuming
the magnetic field B2 to be uniform over the area π r12. However, we
can accept this value because r1 << r2.
Now, let us recollect Experiment 6.3 in Section 6.2. In that experiment,
emf is induced in coil C1 wherever there was any change in current through
coil C2. Let Φ1 be the flux through coil C1 (say of N1 turns) when current in
coil C2 is I2.
Then, from Eq. (6.7), we have

168It shows that varying current in a coil can induce emf in a neighbouring
coil. The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change
of current and mutual inductance of the two coils.
6.7.2  Self-inductance
In the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due
to the current in the other.  It is also possible that emf is induced in a
single isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of
varying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called
self-induction . In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is
proportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as
BN IΦ∝
BL N IΦ= (6.13)
where constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance  of the coil. It
is also called the coefficient of self-induction  of the coil. When the current
is varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced
in the coil. Using Eq. (6.13), the induced emf is given by
()B d–dN
tΦε=
d–dILtε= (6.14)
Thus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change  (increase or
decrease) of current in the coil.
It is possible to calculate the  self-inductance for circuits with simple
geometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-
sectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length. The magnetic
field due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ0 n I  (neglecting edge
effects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is

where nl is the total number of turns. Thus, the self-inductance is,

then,

The self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the
permeability of the medium.
The self-induced emf is also called the back em f as it opposes any
change in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays

So, work needs to be done against the back emf ( ε) in establishing the
current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the

This expression reminds us of mv2/2 for the (mechanical) kinetic energy
of a particle of mass m, and shows that L is analogous to m (i.e., L is
electrical inertia and opposes growth and decay of current in the circuit).
Consider the general case of currents flowing simultaneously in two
nearby coils. The flux linked with one coil will be the sum of two fluxes
which exist independently. Equation (6.7) would be modified into

6.8  AC G ENERA TOR
The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction
has been technologically exploited in many ways.
An exceptionally important application is the
generation of alternating currents (ac). The
modern ac generator with a typical output
capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine.
In this section, we shall describe the basic
principles behind this machine. The Y ugoslav
inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the
development of the machine. As was pointed out
in Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or
current in a loop is through a change in the
loop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.
As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B , the
effective area of the loop (the face perpendicular
to the field) is A cos q, where q is the angle
between A and B. This method of producing a
flux change is the principle of operation of a

171simple ac generator . An ac generator converts mechanical ener gy into
electrical energy.
The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.13. It consists
of a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called
armature) is mechanically rotated in the  uniform magnetic field by some
external means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux through
it to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the
coil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings
and brushes.
When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed w, the angle q
between the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at any
instant t  is q  = wt (assuming q = 0° at t = 0). As a result, the effective area
of the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from
Eq. (6.1), the flux at any time t  is
FB = BA cos q = BA  cos wt
From Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N  turns
is then,
d d– – (cos )dt dBN NBA ttΦε ω = =
Thus, the instantaneous value of the emf is
ε ω ω=NBA sin t (6.19)
where NBA w is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when
sin wt = ±1. If we denote NBA w as e0, then
e = e0 sin wt (6.20)
Since the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or
polarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.14 that the emf
has its extremum value when q = 90° or q = 270°, as the change of flux is
greatest at these points.
The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current
is called alternating curr ent (ac). Since w = 2pn, Eq (6.2 0) can be written as
e = e0sin 2p n t (6.21)
where n is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.
Note that Eq. (6.20) and (6.21) give the instantaneous value of the emf
and e varies between + e0 and – e0 periodically. W e shall lear n how to
determine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current
in the next chapter .
In commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for
rotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for
example, from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators .
Alternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other
sources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the
armatur e. These ar e called thermal generators . Instead of coal, if a
nuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators . Modern day
generators produce electric power as high as 500 MW, i.e., one can light

173SUMMARY
1.The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic
field B is defined as,
FB = B.A = BA cos q
where q is the angle between B and A.
2.Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of N
turns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it,
Bd
dNtΦε= −
Here FB is the flux linked with one turn of the coil.  If the circuit is
closed, a current I = e/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the
circuit.
3.Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it
tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux
that produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law
indicates this fact.
4.When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic
field B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the
induced emf (called motional em f) across its ends is
e = Bl v
5.Inductance is the ratio  of the flux -linkage  to current. It is equal to  NF/I.
6.A changing current in a coil (coil 2) can induce an emf in a nearby coil
(coil 1). This relation is given by,

The quantity M12 is called mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to
coil 2. One can similarly define M21. There exists a general equality,
M12 = M21
7.When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the same
coil. The self-induced emf is given by,
d
dILtε= −
L is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of the
coil against the change of current through it.
8.The self-inductance of a long solenoid, the core of which consists of a
magnetic material of relative per meability mr, is given by
L = mr  m0 n2 Al
where A is the area of cross-section of the solenoid, l its length and n
the number of turns per unit length.
9.In an ac generator , mechanical ener gy is converted to electrical ener gy
by virtue of electromagnetic induction. If coil of N turn and area A  is
rotated at n revolutions per second in a uniform magnetic field B, then
the motional emf produced is
e = NBA (2pn) sin (2pnt)
where we have assumed that at time t = 0 s, the coil is perpendicular to
the field.

174POINTS TO PONDER
1.Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the
nineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others
established that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field.
Somewhat later , around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry
demonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current.
2.In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the
changing magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy.
However , in case of an open cir cuit, an emf is induced acr oss its ends.
How is it related to the flux change?
3.The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently
from Faraday’s law using the Lor entz for ce on moving char ges. However ,
even if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentz
force is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a
time-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static
charges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday’s
law. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle of
relativity for Faraday’s law.
