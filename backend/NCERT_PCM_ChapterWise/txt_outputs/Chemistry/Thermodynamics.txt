Thermodynamics
It is the only physical theory of universal content concerning 
which I am convinced that, within the framework of the applicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown.
Albert Einstein
Chemical energy stored by molecules can be released as 
heat during chemical reactions when a fuel like methane, cooking gas or coal burns in air. The chemical energy may also be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine or to provide electrical energy through a galvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may be transformed from one form into  another. The study of these energy transformations forms the subject matter of thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes of macroscopic systems involving a large number of molecules rather than microscopic systems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out, but is based on initial and final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of thermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium or moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature do not change with time for a system in equilibrium state. In this unit, we would like to answer some of the important questions through thermodynamics, like:
How do we determine the energy changes involved in a 
chemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?
What drives a chemical reaction/process?To what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?  UniT 5

5.1  Thermodynamic Terms
We are interested in chemical reactions and 
the energy changes accompanying them. For this we need to know certain thermodynamic terms. These are discussed below. 
5.1.1
 The system and the surroundings
A system in thermodynamics refers to 
that 
part of universe in which observations are 
made and remaining universe constitutes the surroundings. The surroundings include 
everything other than the system. System and the surroundings together constitute the universe. 
The universe = The system + The surroundings
However, the entire universe other than 
the system is not affected by the changes 
taking place in the system. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the surroundings are that portion of the remaining universe which can interact with the system. Usually, the region of space in the neighbourhood of the system constitutes its surroundings.
For example, if we are studying the 
reaction between two substances A and B kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the reaction mixture is the system and the room where the beaker is kept is the surroundings (Fig. 5.1). 
Fig. 5.1  System and the surroundingsthe system from the surroundings is called boundary. This is designed to allow us to control and keep track of all movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.  
5.1.2 Types of the 
system
We, f
urther classify the systems according 
to the movements of matter and energy in or 
out of the system.
1. Open System
In an open system, there is exchange of energy 
and matter between system and surroundings [Fig. 5.2 
(a)]. The presence of reactants in an 
open beaker is an example of an open system *. 
Here the boundary is an imaginary surface enclosing the beaker and reactants.
2.
 Closed System
In a closed system, 
there is no exchange of 
matter, but exchange of energy is possible 
between system and the surroundings  
[Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a closed vessel made of conducting material e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed system.
Fig. 5.2  Open, closed and isolated systems.Note that the system may be defined 
by physical boundaries, like beaker or test tube, or the system may simply be defined by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying a particular volume in space. It is necessary to think of the system as separated from the surroundings by some sort of wall which may be real or imaginary. The wall that separates 
*  We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.

3. Isolated System
In an isolated system, there is no exchange 
of energy or matter between the system and the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence of reactants 
in a thermos flask or any other 
closed insulated vessel is an example of an isolated system. 
5.1.3
 The state of the system
The system must be described in order to 
make any useful calculations by specifying quantitatively 
each of the properties such as 
its pressure (p), volume (V), and temperature (T ) as well as the composition of the system. 
We need to describe the system by specifying it before and after the change. You would recall from your Physics course that the state of a system in mechanics is completely specified at a given instant of time, by the position and velocity of each mass point of the system. In thermodynamics, a different and much simpler concept of the state of a system is introduced. It does not need detailed knowledge of motion of each particle  because, we deal with average measurable properties of the system. We specify the state of the system by state functions or state variables.
The state of a thermodynamic system is 
described by its measurable or macroscopic  (bulk) properties. We can describe the state of a gas by quoting its pressure (p), volume (V), temperature (T ), amount (n ) etc. Variables 
like p, V, T are called state variables or state 
functions because their values depend only on the state of the system and not on how it is reached. In order to completely define the state of a system it is not necessary to define all the properties of the system; as only a certain number of properties can be varied independently. This number depends on the nature of the system. Once these minimum number of macroscopic properties are fixed, others automatically have definite values.
The state of the surroundings can never 
be completely specified; fortunately it is not 
necessary to do so.
5.1.4
 The internal energy as a state 
Function
When we talk about our chemical system
 
losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce a quantity which represents the total energy 
of the system. It may be chemical, electrical, mechanical or any other type of energy you may think of, the sum of all these is the energy of the system. In thermodynamics, we call it  the internal energy, U of the system, which may change, when
•	heat passes into or out of the system,
•	work is done on or by the system,
•	matter enters or leaves the system. 
These systems are classified accordingly 
as you have already studied in section 5.1.2.
(a) Work 
Let us first examine 
a change in internal energy 
by doing work. We take a system containing 
some quantity of water in a thermos flask or in an insulated beaker. This would not allow exchange of heat between the system and surroundings through its boundary and we call this type of system as adiabatic. The 
manner in which the state of such a system may be changed will be called adiabatic process. Adiabatic process is a process in which there is no transfer of heat between the system and surroundings. Here, the wall separating the system and the surroundings 
is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3).  
Fig. 5.3  An adiabatic system which does not permit the transfer of heat through its boundary.
Let us bring the change in the internal 
energy of the system by doing some work on 
it. Let us call the  initial state of the system as state A and its temperature as  T
A. Let 
the internal energy of the system in state A be called U
A. We can change the state of the 
system in two different ways.
Unit 5.indd   138 9/12/2022   11:53:36 AM

THERMODYNAMICS          139
One way: We do some mechanical work, say 
1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and thereby churning water. Let the new state be called B state and its temperature, as T
B. It is found that TB > TA and the change 
in temperature, ∆T = TB–TA. Let the internal 
energy of the system in state B be UB and the 
change in internal energy, ∆U =UB– UA.
Second way:  We now do an equal amount 
(i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an immersion rod  and note down the temperature change. We find that the change in temperature is same as in the earlier case, say, T
B – TA.
In fact, the experiments in the above 
manner were done by J. P. Joule between 1840–50 and he was able to show that a given amount of work done on the system, no matter how it was done (irrespective of path) produced the same change of state, as measured by the change in the temperature of the system. 
So, it seems appropriate to define a 
quantity, the internal energy U, whose value is characteristic of the state of a system, whereby the adiabatic work, w
ad required to 
bring about a change of state is equal to the difference between the value of U in one state 
and that in another state, ∆U i.e.,
∆U =U
2 –U1= wad
Therefore, internal energy, U , of the 
system is a state function. 
By conventions of IUPAC in chemical 
thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses 
that wad  is positive when work is done on the 
system and the internal energy of system increases. Similarly, if the work is done by the 
system, w
ad will be negative because internal 
energy of the system decreases.
Can you name some other familiar state 
functions? Some of other familiar state functions are V, p, and  T. For example, if we 
bring a change in temperature of the system from 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature is 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight up to 35°C or we cool the system for a few degrees, then take the system to the final temperature. Thus, T is a state function and the change in temperature is independent of the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for example, is a state function, because change in volume of its water is independent of the route by which water is filled in the pond, 
either by rain or by tubewell or by both. 
(b)
 Heat
We can also change the internal energy 
of a 
system by transfer of heat from the 
surroundings to the system or vice-versa without expenditure of work. This exchange of energy, which is a result of temperature difference is called heat, q. Let us consider bringing about the same change in temperature (the same initial and final states as before in section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat through thermally conducting walls instead of adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4). 
We take water at temperature, T
A in a 
container having thermally conducting walls, 
say made up of copper and enclose it in a huge heat reservoir at temperature, T
B. The 
heat absorbed by the system (water), q  can be 
measured in terms of temperature difference, T
B – TA. In this case change in internal energy, 
∆U = q, when no work is done at constant 
volume.
By conventions of IUPAC in chemical 
thermodynamics. The  q is positive, when heat is transferred from the surroundings to the system and the internal energy of the system increases and q is negative when heat is transferred from system to the surroundings resulting in decrease of the internal energy of 
the system. 
* Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the 
system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.Fig. 5.4  A system which allows heat transfer through its boundary.

(c) The general case
Let us consider the 
general case in which 
a change of state is brought about both by  
doing work and by transfer of heat. We write change in internal energy for this case as:
      ∆U = q  + w
        
   (5.1)
For a given change in state, q and w can 
vary depending on how the change is carried 
out. However, q +w = ∆U will depend only on 
initial and final state. It will be independent of the way the change is carried out. If there is no transfer of energy as heat or as work (isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then  
∆ U = 0. The equation 5.1 i.e., ∆U = q  + w is 
mathematical statement of the first law of thermodynamics , which states that 
The energy of an isolated system is constant. 
It is commonly stated as the law of conservation of energy i.e., energy can neither be created nor be destroyed.
note: There is 
considerable difference between 
the character of the thermodynamic property 
energy and that of a mechanical property such as volume. We can specify an unambiguous (absolute) value for volume of a system in a particular state, but not the absolute value of the internal energy. However, we can measure only the changes in the internal energy, ∆U of the system. 
Problem 5.1
Express the change in internal energy 
of a system when
(i) No heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, but work (w) is done on the 
system. What 
type of wall does the system have ?
(ii) No work is done on the system, 
but q  amount of heat is taken out 
from the system and given to 
the 
surroundings. What type of wall does the system have?
(iii)
 w amount of work is done by the system and q 
amount of heat is 
supplied to the system. What type of system would it be?solution 
(i)  ∆ U = w ad, wall is adiabatic
(ii) ∆ U = – q, 
thermally conducting 
walls 
(iii) ∆ U = q
 – w, closed system.
5.2 aPP licaTions
Many chemical reactions involve the generation 
of gases capable of doing mechanical work or the generation of heat. It is important for us to quanti
fy these changes and relate them 
to the changes in the internal energy. Let us see how!
5.2.1
 Work
First
 of all, let us concentrate on the nature of 
work a system can do. We will consider only 
mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.
For understanding pressure-volume 
work,  let us consider a cylinder which 
contains one 
mole of an ideal gas fitted with 
a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas is V
i and pressure of the gas inside is p. If 
external pressure is pex which is greater  than 
p, piston is moved inward till the pressure 
Fig. 5.5 (a)  Work done on an ideal gas in a cylinder 
when it is compressed by 
a constant external pressure, pex 
(in single step) is equal to the shaded area.

THERMODYNAMICS          141
inside becomes equal to pex. Let this change 
be achieved in a single step and the final 
volume be Vf . During this compression, 
suppose piston moves a distance, l and 
is cross-sectional area of the piston is A  
[Fig. 5.5(a)].then, volume change = l × A = ∆V = ( V
f  – Vi )
We also know, pressure = 
Therefore, force on the piston = pex . A
If  w is the work done on the system by movement of the piston then
w = force × distance = p
ex . A . l 
   = pex . (–∆V) = – pex ∆V = – pex (Vf – Vi )       (5.2)
The negative sign of this expression is 
required to obtain conventional sign for w, 
which will be positive. It indicates that in case of compression work is done on the system. Here (V
f – Vi ) will be negative and negative 
multiplied by negative will be positive. Hence the sign obtained for the work will be positive.
If the pressure is not constant at every 
stage of compression, but changes in number of finite steps, work done on the gas will be summed over all the steps and will be equal to – Σ
 р ∆V [Fig. 5.5 (b)] If the pressure is not constant but 
changes during the process such that it 
is always infinitesimally greater than the pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of compression, the volume decreases by an infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case we 
can calculate the work done on the gas by the  
relation
 
w/unif03d/unif02d/unif0f2pd Vex
VV
if
                                 (5.3)
Here, pex at each stage is equal to (pin + dp) 
in case of compression [Fig. 5.5(c)]. In an 
expansion process under similar conditions, the external pressure is always less than the pressure of the system i.e., p
ex = (pin– dp). In 
general case we can write, pex = (pin +  dp). Such 
processes are called reversible processes.
a process or change is said to be 
reversible, if 
a change is brought out in such a 
way that the process could, at any moment, be reversed by an infinitesimal change. A reversible process proceeds infinitely slowly by a series of equilibrium states such that system and the surroundings are always in near equilibrium with each other.

Processes other than reversible processes 
are known as irreversible processes.
In chemistry, we face problems that can 
be solved if we relate the work term to the internal pressure of the system. We can relate work to internal pressure of the system under reversible conditions by writing 
equation 5.3 as follows:

if/unif03d/unif02d/unif0f2pVin                                (5.4)

can write as p  now) can be expressed in terms 
of its volume through gas equation. For n  mol

Free expansion: Expansion of a gas in
 
vacuum ( pex = 0) is called free expansion. 
No work is done during free expansion of an 
ideal gas whether the process is reversible or irreversible (equation 5.2 and 5.3).
Now, we  can write equation 5.1 in number 
of ways depending on the type of processes.
Let us substitute w = – p

equation 5.1, and we get

THERMODYNAMICS          143
Remember ∆H = qp, heat absorbed by the  
system at constant pressure. 
∆H is negative for exothermic reactions 
which evolve heat during the reaction and 
∆H is positive for endothermic reactions which absorb heat from the surroundings. 
At constant volume ( ∆V = 0),  ∆U = q
V, 
therefore equation 5.8 becomes 
∆H = ∆U = qV
The difference between  ∆H and ∆U is not 
usually significant for systems consisting of only solids and / or liquids. Solids and liquids do not suffer any significant volume changes upon heating. The difference, however, becomes significant when gases are involved. Let us consider a reaction involving gases. If V
A is the total volume of the gaseous 
reactants, VB is the total volume of the gaseous 
products, nA is the number of moles of gaseous 
reactants and nB is the number of moles of 
gaseous products, all at constant pressure and temperature, then using the ideal gas 
law, we write,
  pVA = nART
and  pVB = nBRT
Thus,  pVB – pVA = nBRT – nART = (nB–nA)RT 
or p (VB – VA) = (nB – nA) RT
or       p ∆V = ∆ngRT (5.9)
Here, ∆ng refers to the number of moles of 
gaseous products minus the number of moles 
of gaseous reactants.
Substituting the value of p∆V from 
equation 5.9 in equation 5.8, we get 
∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT (5.10)
The equation 5.10 is useful for calculating 
∆H from ∆
U and vice versa.

perfect gas, molar enthalpy change for vapourisation of 1 mol of water at 1bar and 100°C is 41kJ mol

enthalpy, H
(a) A Useful New State Function
We know 
that the heat absorbed at constant 
volume is equal to change in the internal 
energy i.e., ∆ U = qV. But most of chemical 
reactions are carried out not at constant volume, but in flasks or test tubes under constant atmospheric pressure. We need to define another state function which may be suitable under these conditions. 
We may write equation (5.1) as  
∆U = q
p – p∆V at constant pressure, where 
qp  is heat absorbed by the system and – p∆V 
represent expansion work done by the system.
Let us represent the initial state by  
subscript 1 and final state by 2
We can rewrite the above equation as 
U2–U1 = qp – p (V2 – V1)
On rearranging, we getq
p = (U2 + pV2) – (U1 + pV1) (5.6)
Now we can define 
another thermodynamic 
function, the enthalpy H [Greek word 
enthalpien, to warm or heat content] as :
H = U + pV    (5.7)  
so, equation (5.6) becomes
qp= H2 – H1 = ∆H
Although q is a path dependent function, 
H is a state function because it depends on 
U, p and V, all of which are state functions. 
Therefore, ∆H is independent of path. Hence, 
qp is also independent of path.
For finite changes at constant pressure, 
we can write equation 5.7 as
∆H = ∆U + ∆pV
Since p is constant, we can write ∆H = ∆U + p∆V
 (5.8)
It is important to note that when heat is 
absorbe
d by the system at constant pressure, 
we are actually measuring changes in the 
enthalpy.

values, we get
∆U = 41.00 kJ mol–1 – 1
   × 8.3 J mol–1 K–1 × 373 K
= 41.00 kJ mol-1 – 3.096 kJ mol-1
= 37.904 kJ mol–1
(c) Heat Capacity
In this sub-section, let us see how to measure 
heat transferred to a system. This heat appears as a rise in temperature of the system in case of heat absorbed by the system. 
The increase of temperature is proportional 
to the heat transferred 
qc oeffT /unif03d/unif0b4 /unif044
The magnitude of the coefficient depends 
on the size, composition and nature of the 
system. We can also write it as q = C ∆T
The coefficient, C is called the heat 
capacity. 
Thus, we can measure the heat supplied 
by monitoring the temperature rise, provided we know the heat capacity. 
When C is large, a given amount of heat 
results in only a small temperature rise. Water has a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy is needed to raise its temperature. 
C is directly proportional to amount of 
substance. The molar heat capacity of a 
substance, C
m=C
n/unif0e6
/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6
/unif0f8/unif0f7, is the heat capacity  
for one mole of the substance and is 
the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole by one degree celsius (or one kelvin). Specific heat, also called specific heat capacity is the quantity Fig. 5.6(a)  A gas at volume V and temperature T
Fig. 5.6 (b)  Partition, each part having half the volume of the gas
(b) Extensive and Intensive Properties
In thermodynamics, a distinction is made   
between extensive properties and intensive properties. An extensive property is a 
property whose value depends on the quantity or size of matter present in the system. For example, mass, volume, internal energy, enthalpy, heat capacity, etc. are extensive properties.
Those properties which do not depend 
on the quantity or size of matter present are known as intensive properties. For 
example temperature, density, pressure etc. are intensive properties. A molar property, 
χ
m, is the value of an extensive property χ of 
the system for 1 mol of the substance. If n is 
the amount of matter, /unif063/unif063
m/unif03dn is independent 
of the amount of matter. Other examples are 
molar volume, Vm and molar heat capacity, 
Cm. Let us understand the distinction 
between extensive and intensive properties by considering a gas enclosed in a container of volume V and at temperature T [Fig. 5.6(a)]. 
Let us make a partition such that volume is halved, each part [Fig. 5.6 (b)] now has 
one half of the original volume, 
V
2, but the 
temperature will still remain the same i.e., T. 
It is clear that volume is an extensive property 
and temperature is an intensive property.

(d) The Relationship between Cp and CV  
 for an Ideal Gas 
At constant volume, the heat capacity, C is  denoted by C
V  and at constant pressure, this 
is denoted by Cp . Let us find the relationship 
between the two.
We can write equation for heat, q
at constant volume as qV = CT UV/unif044/unif044/unif03d
at constant pressure as qp = CT Hp/unif044/unif044/unif03d
The difference between Cp and CV can be 
derived for an ideal gas as: 
For a mole of an ideal gas, ∆H = ∆U + ∆(pV )

calorime Try
We can measure energy changes associated 
with 
chemical or physical processes by an 
experimental technique called calorimetry. In calorimetry, the process is carried out in a vessel called calorimeter, which is immersed in a known volume of a liquid. Knowing the heat capacity of the liquid in which calorimeter is immersed and the heat capacity of calorimeter, it is possible to determine the heat evolved in the process by measuring temperature changes. Measurements are made under two different conditions: i)   at constant volume,  q
V 
ii)  at constant pressure,  qp
(a) ∆U Measurements
For chemical reactions, heat absorbed at 
constant volume, is measured in a bomb calorimeter (Fig. 5.7). Here, a steel vessel (the bomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole device is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is immersed in water bath to ensure that no heat is lost to the surroundings. A combustible 
 Fig. 5.7  Bomb calorimeter
substance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied  
in the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the 
reaction is transferred to the water around the bomb and its temperature is monitored. Since the bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume does not change i.e., the energy changes associated with reactions are measured at constant volume. Under these conditions, no work is done as the reaction is carried out at constant volume in the bomb calorimeter. Even for reactions involving gases, there is no work done as ∆V = 0. Temperature change of the calorimeter produced by the completed reaction is then converted to q
V, by using the 
known heat capacity of the calorimeter with the help of equation 5.11.

(b) ∆H Measurements
Measurement of heat change at constant 
pressure (generally under atmospheric pressure) can be done in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 5.8. We know that ∆Η = q
p (at constant p ) and, 
therefore, heat absorbed or evolved, qp at 
constant pressure is also called the heat of reaction or enthalpy of reaction,  ∆
rH. 
In an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved, 
and system loses heat to the surroundings. 
Therefore, qp will be negative and ∆rH will 
also be negative. Similarly in an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed, q
p is positive and 
∆rH will be positive.

calorimeter in excess of oxygen at 298 K and 1 atmospheric pressure according to the equation

what is the enthalpy change for the above reaction at 298 K and 1 atm?
solution
Suppose q is 
the quantity of heat from 
the reaction mixture and CV is the 
heat capacity of the calorimeter, then the quantity of heat absorbed by the calorimeter. 
q = C
V × ∆T
Quantity of heat from the reaction will 
have the same magnitude but opposite sign because the heat lost by the system (reaction mixture) is equal to the heat gained by the calorimeter.
q = –C
V × ∆T = – 20.7 kJ/K × (299 – 298) K
= – 20.7 kJ
(Here, negative sign indicates the 
exothermic nature of the reaction)

where Hm is the molar enthalpy.
Enthalpy change is a very useful quantity.  
Knowledge of this quantity is required when 
one needs to plan the heating or cooling required to maintain an industrial chemical reaction at constant temperature. It is also required to calculate temperature dependence of equilibrium constant.
(a) Standard Enthalpy of Reactions
Enthalpy of a reaction depends on the 
conditions under which a reaction is carried out. It is, therefore, necessary that we must specify some standard conditions.  
The standard enthalpy of reaction is the enthalpy change for a reaction when all the participating substances are in their standard states.
The standard state of a substance at a 
specified temperature is its pure form at  
1 bar. For example, the standard state of liquid ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at  
1 bar; standard state of solid iron at 500 K 
is pure iron at 1 bar. Usually data are taken at 298 K.
Standard conditions are denoted by 
adding the superscript  to the symbol ∆H, 
e.g., ∆ H

(b) Enthalpy Changes during Phase 
Transformations
Phase transformations also involve energy 
changes. Ice, for example, requires heat for melting. 
Normally this melting takes place at 
constant pressure (atmospheric pressure) and during phase change, temperature remains constant (at 273 K).
H

Here ∆fusH is enthalpy of fusion in standard 
state. If water freezes, then process is reversed 
and equal amount of heat is given off to the surroundings. 
The enthalpy change that accompanies 
melting of one mole of a solid substance  in standard state is called standard enthalpy of fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion, ∆
fusH.
Melting of a solid is endothermic, so 
all enthalpies of fusion are positive. Water

∆vapH is the standard enthalpy of vaporisation.
Amount of heat required to vaporize one 
mole of a liquid at constant temperature 
and under standard pressure (1bar) is called its standard enthalpy of vaporization or molar enthalpy of vaporization, ∆
vapH. 
Sublimation is direct conversion of a 
solid into its vapour. Solid CO2 or ‘dry ice’

standard enth
alpy of sublimation, 
∆subH is the change in enthalpy when one 
mole of a solid substance sublimes at a constant temperature and under standard pressure (1bar).
The magnitude of the enthalpy change 
depends on the strength of the intermolecular interactions in the substance undergoing the phase transfomations. For example, the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them tightly in liquid phase. For an organic liquid, such as acetone, the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions are significantly weaker. Thus, it requires less heat to vaporise 1 mol of acetone than it does to vaporize 1 mol of water. Table 5.1 gives values of standard enthalpy changes of fusion and vaporisation for some substances.solution

of aggregation (also known as reference 
states)  is called standard molar enthalpy 
of Formation. its symbol is ∆fH, where the 
subscript ‘ f ’ indicates that one mole of the 
compound in question has been formed in its standard state from its elements in their most stable states of aggregation. The reference state of an element is its most stable state of aggregation at 25°C and 1 bar pressure.  
For example, the reference state of dihydrogen is H
2 gas and those of dioxygen, carbon 
and sulphur are O2 gas, Cgraphite and Srhombic 
respectively. Some reactions with standard molar enthalpies of formation are as follows. Table 5.2  standard molar enthalpies of Formation (∆f H) at 298K of a Few

Therefore,
  ∆H = - 7.56 kJ mol-1 + (-6.00 kJ mol-1)

There is negligible change in the volume

H2(g) + ½O2 (g) → H2O(1);
∆f H = –285.8 kJ mol–1
C (graphite, s) + 2H2(g) → Ch4 (g);
∆f H = –74.81 kJ mol–1
2C (graphite, s)+3H2 (g)+ ½O2(g) → C2H5OH(1);
∆f H  = – 277.7kJ mol–1
It is important to understand that a 
standard molar enthalpy of formation, ∆fH , 
is just a special case of ∆rH , where one mole 
of a compound is formed from its constituent 
elements, as in the above three equations, where 1 mol of each, water, methane and ethanol is formed. In contrast, the enthalpy change for an exothermic reaction:
CaO(s) + CO
2(g) → CaCo3(s);
∆rH  = – 178.3kJ mol–1
is not an enthalpy of formation of calcium 
carbonate, since calcium carbonate has been formed from other compounds, and not from its constituent elements. Also, for the reaction given below, enthalpy change is not standard enthalpy of formation, ∆
fH  for HBr(g).
H2(g) + Br2(l) → 2HBr(g);
 ∆r H  = – 178.3kJ mol–1
Here two moles, instead of one mole of the 
product is formed from the elements, i.e., 
∆r H  = 2∆f H
Therefore, by dividing all coefficients in 
the balanced equation by 2, expression for 
enthalpy of formation of HBr (g) is written as ½H
2(g) + ½Br2(1) → HBr(g);
∆f H = – 36.4 kJ mol–1
Standard enthalpies of formation of some 
common substances are given in Table 5.2.
By convention, standard enthalpy for 
formation, ∆fH, of an element in reference 
state, i.e., its most stable state of aggregation is taken as zero. 
Suppose, you are a chemical engineer and 
want to know how much heat is required to decompose calcium carbonate to lime and carbon dioxide, with all the substances in their standard state. 
CaCO
3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g); ∆r H  = ?Here, we can make use of standard enthalpy of formation and calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction. The following general equation can be used for the enthalpy change calculation. 
∆
rH = 
i∑ai ∆f H (products) – 
i∑bi ∆f H (reactants)
                 (5.15)
where a and b 
represent the coefficients of 
the products and reactants in the balanced 
equation. Let us apply the above equation for decomposition of calcium carbonate. Here, coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ are 1 each. Therefore,
∆
rH = ∆f H  = [CaO(s)]+ ∆f H  [CO2(g)]
– ∆f H  = [CaCO3(s)]
=1 (–635.1 kJ mol–1) + 1(–393.5 kJ mol–1)
–1(–1206.9 kJ mol–1)
= 178.3 kJ mol–1
Thus, the decomposition of CaCO3 (s) is 
an endothermic process and you have to heat 
it for getting the desired products. 
(d) Thermochemical Equations
A balanced chemical equation together with 
the value of its ∆rH is called a thermochemical 
equation. We specify the physical state (alongwith allotropic state) of the substance in an equation. For example: 
C
2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l);
∆rH = – 1367 kJ mol–1
The above equation describes the 
combustion of liquid ethanol at constant 
temperature and pressure. The negative sign of enthalpy change indicates that this is an  
exothermic reaction. 
It would be necessary to remember the 
following conventions regarding thermo-
chemical equations. 
1.
 The coefficients in a 
balanced thermo-
chemical equation refer to the number of moles (never molecules) of reactants and products involved in the reaction. 
2.
 The numerical value of ∆rH refers to the 
number of moles of substances specified by an equation. Standard enthalpy change ∆
rH will have units as kJ mol–1.

To illustrate the concept, let us consider 
the calculation of heat of reaction for the 
following  reaction :
FeOs Hg FesH Ol23 2232 3 /unif028/unif029/unif02b /unif028/unif029/unif0ae /unif028/unif029/unif02b /unif028/unif029,
From the Table (5.2) of standard enthalpy of formation ( ∆
f H), we find :
∆f H (H2O,l) = –285.83 kJ mol–1;
∆f H (Fe2O3,s)  = – 824.2 kJ mol–1; 
Also  ∆f H (Fe, s) = 0 and
         ∆f H (H2, g) = 0 as per convention
Then, 
∆f H1 = 3(–285.83 kJ mol–1) 
                                 – 1(– 824.2 kJ mol–1)
         =  (–857.5 + 824.2) kJ mol–1
               =  –33.3 kJ mol–1
Note that the coefficients used in these 
calculations are pure numbers, which are equal to the respective stoichiometric coefficients. The unit for ∆
rH is  
kJ mol–1, which means per mole of reaction. 
Once we balance the chemical equation in a particular way, as above, this defines the mole 
of reaction. If we had balanced the equation differently, for example,

then this amount of reaction would be one mole of reaction and ∆
rH would be
∆f H2 = 3

          – 1
2(–824.2 kJ mol–1)
  = (– 428.7 + 412.1) kJ mol–1
= –16.6 kJ mol–1 =  ½ ∆r H1 
It shows that enthalpy is an extensive quantity.
3.
 When a chemical equation is reversed, 
the value of ∆rH is reversed in sign. For 
example
N2(g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g);
∆r H = – 91.8 kJ. mol–1
2NH3(g) → N2(g) + 3H2 (g);
∆r H = + 91.8 kJ mol–1(e) Hess’s Law of Constant Heat Summation 
We know that enthalpy is a state function, theref
ore the change in enthalpy is independent  
of the path between initial state (reactants) and final state (products). In other words, enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or in a series of steps. This may be stated as follows in the form of Hess’s Law.
if a reaction takes place in several 
steps then its standard reaction enthalpy is the sum of the standard 
enthalpies of 
the intermediate reactions into which the overall reaction may be divided at the same temperature.
Let us understand the importance of this 
law with the help of an example.
Consider the enthalpy change for the 
reaction
C (graphite,s) +
  O2 (g) → CO (g); ∆r H  = ?
Although CO(g) is the major product, some 
CO2 gas is always produced in this reaction. 
Therefore, we cannot measure enthalpy 
change for the above reaction directly. However, if we can find some other reactions involving related species, it is possible to calculate the enthalpy change for the above reaction. 
Let us consider the following reactions:  
C (graphite,s) + O
2 (g) → CO2 (g); 
∆r H = – 393.5 kJ mol–1 (i)
CO (g) + 1
2O2 (g) → CO2 (g)
∆r H = – 283.0 kJ mol–1 (ii)
We can combine the above two reactions 
in such a way so as to obtain the desired 
reaction. To get one mole of CO(g) on the right, we reverse equation (ii). In this, heat is absorbed instead of being released, so we change sign of ∆
rH value
CO2 (g) → CO (g) +   O2 (g);
∆r H = + 283.0 kJ mol–1 (iii)

Combustion reactions are exothermic in nature. These are important in industry, rocketry, and other walks of life. Standard enthalpy of combustion is defined as the enthalpy change per mole (or per unit amount) of a substance, when it undergoes combustion and all the reactants and products being

Cooking gas in cylinders contains mostly 
butane (C

(c) Bond Enthalpy (symbol: ∆bondH)
Chemical reactions involve the breaking and 
making of chemical bonds. Energy is required to break a bond and energy is released when a bond is formed. It is possible to relate heat of reaction to changes in energy associated with breaking and making of chemical bonds. With reference to the enthalpy changes associated with chemical bonds, two different terms are used in thermodynamics.
 (i)
 Bond dissociation enthalpy
(ii) Mean bond enthalpy
Let us discuss these 
terms with reference 
to diatomic and polyatomic molecules.
Diatomic Molecules: Consider the following 
process in which the bonds in one mole of dihydrogen gas (H
2) are broken:
H2(g)  →  2H(g);  ∆H–HH  = 435.0 kJ mol–1
The enthalpy change involved in this process is the bond dissociation enthalpy of H–H bond. The bond dissociation enthalpy is the change in enthalpy when one mole of covalent bonds of a gaseous covalent compound is broken to form products in the gas phase.
Note that it is the same as the enthalpy of 
atomization of dihydrogen. This is true for all diatomic molecules. For example:
Cl
2(g)  →  2Cl(g);  ∆Cl–ClH  = 242 kJ mol–1
O2(g)  →  2O(g);  ∆O=OH  = 428 kJ mol–1
In the case of polyatomic molecules, bond 
dissociation enthalpy is different for different 
bonds within the same molecule.
Polyatomic Molecules: Let us now consider 
a polyatomic molecule like methane, CH4. 
The overall thermochemical equation for its atomization reaction is given below: 
4CH (g) C(g) 4H(g);→+
∆a H  = 1665 kJ mol–1
In methane, all the four C – H bonds are 
identical in bond length and energy. However, the energies required to break the individual C – H bonds in each successive step differ :(b)
 Enthalpy of Atomization  (symbol: ∆
aH)
Consider the following example of atomization 
of dihydrogen 
H2(g)  →  2H(g);  ∆aH = 435.0 kJ mol–1
You can see that H atoms are formed by 
breaking H–H bonds in dihydrogen. The enthalpy change in this process is known as enthalpy of atomization, ∆
aH. It is the 
enthalpy change on breaking one mole of bonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas phase.
In case of diatomic molecules, like 
dihydrogen (given above), the enthalpy of atomization is also the bond dissociation enthalpy. The other examples of enthalpy of atomization can be 
CH
4(g)  →  C(g) + 4H(g); ∆aH  = 1665 kJ mol–1
Note that the products are only atoms of C 
and H in gaseous phase. Now see the following 
reaction:
Na(s)  →  Na(g);  ∆aH  = 108.4 kJ mol–1

chemIstry154
CH4(g) → CH3(g)+H(g); ∆bond H = +427 kJ mol–1
CH3(g) → CH2(g)+H(g); ∆bond H = +439 kJ mol–1
CH2(g) → CH(g)+H(g); ∆bond H = +452 kJ mol–1
CH(g) → C(g)+H(g); ∆bond H = +347 kJ mol–1
Therefore,
CH4(g) → C(g)+4H(g); ∆a H = 1665 kJ mol–1
In such cases we use mean bond enthalpy 
of c – h bond .
For example in CH4, ∆C–HH  is calculated as: 
∆C–HH = ¼ (∆a H) = ¼ (1665 kJ mol–1)
                              = 416 kJ mol–1
We find that mean C–H bond enthalpy 
in methane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been found that mean C–H bond enthalpies differ slightly from compound to compound, as in CH
3CH2Cl, CH3NO2, etc., but it does not 
differ in a great deal*. Using Hess’s law, bond enthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy values of some single and multiple bonds are given in Table 5.3. The reaction enthalpies are very important quantities as these arise from the changes that accompany the breaking of old bonds and formation of the new bonds. We can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas phase, if we know different bond enthalpies. The standard enthalpy of reaction, ∆
rH is 
related to bond enthalpies of the reactants and products in gas phase reactions as:
∆
r H       
(5.17)**
This r
elationship is particularly more 
useful when the required values of ∆f H are 
not available. The net enthalpy change of a 
reaction is the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in the reactant molecules minus the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in the product molecules. Remember that this relationship is approximate and is valid when all substances /unif03d

(d)  Lattice Enthalpy
The lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is 
the enthalpy change which occurs when one mole of an ionic compound dissociates into its ions in gaseous state.

  ∆latticeH = +788 kJ mol–1
Since it is impossible to determine lattice 
enthalpies directly by experiment, we use 
an indirect method where we construct an 
enthalpy diagram called a Born- haber cycle 
(Fig. 5.9).
Let us 
now calculate the lattice enthalpy 
of Na+Cl–(s) by following steps given below : 
1. NasN ag () () → , sublimation of sodium   
metal,  ∆subH = 108.4 kJ mol–12. NagN ag eg () () () /unif0ae/unif02b/unif02b/unif02d 1, the ionization of

 You have learnt about ionization enthalpy 
and elec
tron gain enthalpy in Unit 3. 
In fact, these terms have been taken from thermodynamics. Earlier terms, ionization energy and electron affinity were in practice in place of the above terms (see the box for justification).

The sequence of steps is shown in  
Fig. 5.9, and is known as a Born-Haber Ionization Energy and Electron Affinity
Ionization energy and electron affinity 
are defined at absolute zero. At any other temperature, heat capacities for the reactants and the products have to be taken into account. Enthalpies of reactions for

The value of Cp for each species in the above 
reaction is 5/2 R  ( CV = 3/2R) 
So,  ∆rCp  = + 5/2 R (for ionization)
       ∆rCp  = – 5/2 R (for electron gain)
Therefore, 
∆rH (ionization enthalpy ) 
          = E0 (ionization energy) + 5/2 R T
∆rH  (electron gain enthalpy) 
         = – A( electron affinity) – 5/2 R T

The enthalpy of solution of AB(s), ∆solH, 
in water is, therefore, determined by the 
selective values of the lattice enthalpy, ∆latticeH  
and enthalpy of hydration of ions, ∆hydH as 
∆sol H  = ∆latticeH  + ∆hydH 
For most of the ionic compounds, ∆sol 
H is positive and the dissociation process 
is endothermic. Therefore the solubility of most salts in water increases with rise of 
temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very high, the dissolution of the compound may not take place at all. Why do many fluorides tend to be less soluble than the corresponding chlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of enthalpy changes may be made by using tables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice energies (enthalpies).
(f)   Enthalpy of Dilution 
It is known that enthalpy of solution is the 
enthalpy change associated with the addition 
of a specified amount of solute to the specified amount of solvent at a constant temperature and pressure. This argument can be applied to any solvent with slight modification. Enthalpy change for dissolving one mole of gaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water can be represented by the following equation. For convenience we will use the symbol aq. for water 
HCl(g) + 10 aq. → HCl.10 aq. 
 
∆H = –69.01 kJ / mol
Let us 
consider the following set of 
enthalpy changes:(S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. → HCl.25 aq. 
 
∆H = –72.03 kJ / mol 
(S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. → HCl.40 aq.  
∆H = –72.79 kJ / mol
(S-3) HCl(g) +  ∞ aq. →
 HCl. ∞ aq.  
∆H = –74.85 kJ / mol
The values of ∆ H show general dependence 
of
 the enthalpy of solution on amount of 
solvent. As more and more solvent is used, 
the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting value, i.e, the value in infinitely dilute solution. For hydrochloric acid this value of ∆H is given above in equation (S-3). cycle. The importance of the cycle is that, 
the sum of the enthalpy changes round a cycle is zero. Applying Hess’s law, we get,
∆
latticeH = 411.2 + 108.4 + 121 + 496 – 348.6
∆latticeH = + 788kJ
for NaCl(s)   Na+(g) + Cl–(g)
Internal energy is smaller by 2RT (because ∆ng 
= 2) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol–1.
Now we use the value of lattice enthalpy 
to calculate enthalpy of solution from the expression:
∆
solH = ∆latticeH + ∆hydH 
For one mole of NaCl(s), 
lattice enthalpy  = + 788 kJ mol–1
and ∆hydH = – 784 kJ mol–1( from the   
literature)
∆sol H = + 788 kJ mol–1 – 784 kJ mol–1
            = + 4 kJ mol–1
The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied 
by very little heat change. 
(e)   Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : ∆solH )
Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the 
enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy change observed on dissolving the substance in an infinite amount of solvent when the interactions between the ions (or solute molecules) are negligible. 
When an ionic compound dissolves in a 
solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions on the crystal lattice. These are now more free in solution. But solvation of these ions (hydration in case solvent is water) also occurs at the 
same time. This is shown diagrammatically, for an ionic compound, AB (s)

If we subtract the first equation (equation 
S-1) from the second equation (equation S-2) 
in the above set of equations, we obtain– 
HCl.25 aq. + 15 aq. → HCl.40 aq.  
∆H = [ –72.79 – (–72.03)] kJ / mol  
      = – 0.76 kJ / mol  
This value (–0.76kJ/mol) of ∆ H is enthalpy 
of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from 
the surroundings when additional solvent is added to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution of a solution is dependent on the original concentration of the solution and the amount of solvent added.

The first
 law of thermodynamics tells us 
about the relationship between the heat 
absorbed and the work performed on or by a system. It puts no restrictions on the direction of heat flow. However, the flow of heat is unidirectional from higher temperature to lower temperature. In fact, all naturally occurring processes whether chemical or physical will tend to proceed spontaneously in one direction only. For example, a gas expanding to fill the available volume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving carbon dioxide. 
But heat will not flow from colder body to 
warmer body on its own, the gas in a container will not spontaneously contract into one corner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon and dioxygen spontaneously. These and many other spontaneously occurring changes show unidirectional change. We may ask ‘what is the driving force of spontaneously occurring changes ? What determines the direction of a spontaneous change ? In this section, we shall establish some criterion for these processes whether these will take place or not.
Let us first understand what do we mean 
by spontaneous reaction or change ? You may think by your common observation that spontaneous reaction is one which occurs immediately when contact is made between the reactants. Take the case of combination of hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may be mixed at room temperature and left for many years without observing any perceptible change. Although the reaction is taking place between them, it is at an extremely slow rate. It is still called spontaneous reaction. So spontaneity means ‘having the potential to proceed without the assistance of external agency’. However, it does not tell about the rate of the reaction or process. Another aspect of spontaneous reaction or process, as we see is that these cannot reverse their direction on their own. We may summarise it as  follows: 
A spontaneous process is an  irreversible process and may only be reversed by some external agency.
(a)  Is Decrease in Enthalpy a Criterion  
 for Spontaneity ?
If we examine the phenomenon like flow of water down hill or fall of a stone on to the ground, we find that there is a net decrease in potential energy in the direction of change. By analogy, we may be tempted to state that  a chemical reaction is spontaneous in a given direction, because decrease in energy has taken place, as in the case of exothermic reactions. For example:
1
2N2(g) + H2(g) = NH3(g); 
                                       ∆r H  = – 46.1 kJ mol–1

2H2(g) + 1
2Cl2(g) = HCl (g);
                                    ∆r H  = – 92.32 kJ mol–1
H2(g) + 1
2 O2(g) → H2O(l) ;
                                    ∆r H  = –285.8 kJ mol–1
The decrease in enthalpy in passing from 
reactants to products may be shown for any exothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram as shown in Fig. 5.10(a). 
Thus, the postulate that driving force for 
a chemical reaction may be due to decrease in energy sounds ‘reasonable’ as the basis of evidence so far !
Now let us examine the following reactions:
1
2 N2(g) + O2(g) → NO2(g); 
                                       ∆r H = +33.2 kJ mol–1
C(graphite, s) + 2 S(l) → CS2(l);  
                                     ∆r H = +128.5 kJ mol–1

These reactions  though endothermic, are 
spontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may 
be represented on an enthalpy diagram as shown in Fig. 5.10(b).Fig. 5.10 (a)  Enthalpy diagram for exothermic

respectively and separated by a movable partition [Fig. 5.11 (a)]. When the partition is withdrawn [Fig. 5.11(b)], the gases begin to diffuse into each other and after a period of time, diffusion will be complete.
Let us examine the process. Before 
partition, if we were to pick up the gas molecules from left container, we would be sure that these will be molecules of gas A and similarly if we were to pick up the gas molecules from right container, we would be sure that these will be molecules of gas B. But, if we were to pick up molecules from container when partition is removed, we are not sure whether the molecules picked are of gas A or gas B. We say that the system has become less predictable or more chaotic. 
We may now formulate another postulate:  
in an isolated system, there is always a tendency for the systems’ energy to become more disordered or chaotic and this could be a criterion for spontaneous change !
At this point, we introduce another 
thermodynamic function, entropy denoted as S. The above mentioned disorder is the 
manifestation of entropy. To form a mental Therefore, it becomes obvious that while 
decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory factor for spontaneity, but it is not true for all cases.
(b) Entropy and SpontaneityThen, what drives the spontaneous process 
in a given direction ?  Let us examine such a case in which ∆ H = 0 i.e., there is no change in 
enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.
Let us consider diffusion of two gases 
into each other in a closed container which is isolated from the surroundings as shown in Fig. 5.11. 
The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are 
represented by black dots and white dots

picture, one can think of entropy as a measure 
of the degree of randomness or disorder in the system. The greater the disorder in an isolated system, the higher is the entropy.  As far as a chemical reaction is concerned, this entropy change  can be attributed to rearrangement of atoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants to another (in the products). If the structure of the products is very much disordered than that of the reactants, there will be a resultant increase in entropy. The change in entropy accompanying a chemical reaction may be estimated qualitatively by a consideration of the structures of the species taking part in the reaction. Decrease of regularity in structure would mean increase in entropy. For a given substance, the crystalline solid state is the state of lowest entropy (most ordered), The gaseous state is state of highest entropy.
Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way 
to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic distribution of energy among molecules would be through statistical method which is beyond the scope of this treatment. Other way would be to relate this process to the heat involved in a process which would make entropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy, like any other thermodynamic property such as internal energy U  and enthalpy H  is a state 
function and ∆S is independent of path.
Whenever heat is added to the system, 
it increases molecular motions causing increased randomness in the system. Thus heat (q) has randomising influence on the system. Can we then equate ∆ S with q  ? Wait !  
Experience suggests us that the distribution of heat also depends on the temperature at which heat is added to the system. A system at higher temperature has greater randomness in it
  than one at l
ower temperature. Thus, 
temperature is the measure of average chaotic motion of particles in the system. Heat added to a system at lower temperature causes greater randomness than when the same quantity of heat is added to it at higher temperature. This suggests that the entropy change is inversely proportional to the temperature. ∆S is related with q and T for a 
reversible reaction as : ∆S =
q

system and surroundings of a spontaneous process is given by
/unif044/unif044 /unif044 SS Stotals ystems urr /unif03d/unif02b /unif03e0                   (5.19)
When a system is in equilibrium, the 
entropy is maximum, and the change in entropy, ∆S = 0.
We can say that entropy for a spontaneous 
process increases till it reaches maximum and at equilibrium the change in entropy is zero. Since entropy is a state property, we can calculate the change in entropy of a reversible process by
∆S
sys = qsysrev,
T  
We find that both for reversible and 
irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under 
isothermal conditions, ∆U = 0,   but ∆Stotal  
i.e., /unif044/unif044SSsyss urr /unif02b is not zero for irreversible 
process. Thus,   ∆U does not discriminate 
between reversible and irreversible process, 
whereas 
∆S does.

(c) Gibbs Energy and Spontaneity
We have seen that 
for a system, it is the 
total entropy change, ∆ Stotal which decides 
the spontaneity of the process. But most of the chemical reactions fall into the category of either closed systems or open systems. Therefore, for most of the chemical reactions there are changes in both enthalpy and entropy. It is clear from the discussion in previous sections that neither decrease in enthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can determine the direction of spontaneous change for these systems.
For this purpose, we define a new 
thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy or Gibbs function, G, as 
G = H – TS                                      (5.20)
Gibbs function, G is an extensive property 
and a state function.

Usually the subscript ‘system’ is dropped 
and we simply write this equation as 
 /unif044/unif044 /unif044 GH TS /unif03d/unif02d                                  (5.21)
Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy 
change – temperature × entropy change, and 
is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of the most important equations in chemistry. Here, we have considered both terms together for spontaneity: energy (in terms of ∆ H) 
and entropy (∆S, a measure of disorder) as indicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse, we find that ∆G has units of energy because, 
both ∆H and the T
∆S are energy terms, since 
T∆S = (K) (J/K) = J.
Now let us consider how ∆G is related to 
reaction spontaneity.

We know, 
∆Stotal = ∆Ssys +  ∆Ssurr
   If the system is in thermal equilibrium with 
the surrounding, then the temperature of the 
surrounding is same as that of the system. Also, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding
 
is equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the system.

∆Hsys is the enthalpy change of a reaction, 
T∆Ssys is the energy which is not available to do 
useful work. So ∆ G is the net energy available 
to do useful work and is thus a measure of the 
‘free energy’. For this reason, it is also known 
as the free energy of the reaction.
∆G gives a criteria for spontaneity at 
constant pressure and temperature.
(i) If ∆G is negative (< 0), the process is 
spontaneous.
(ii) If ∆G is positive (> 0), the process is non 
spontaneous.
note : If a 
reaction has a positive enthalpy 
change and positive entropy change, it can 
be spontaneous when T∆S is large enough to outweigh ∆H. This can happen in two ways;  
(a) The positive entropy change of the system can be ‘small’ in which case T  must be 
large. (b) The positive entropy change of the system can be ‘large’, in which case T may be small. The former is one of the reasons why reactions are often carried out at high temperature. Table 5.4 summarises the effect of temperature on spontaneity of reactions.
(d)
 Entropy and Second Law of 
Thermodynamics
We know that for an isolated system
 
the change in energy remains constant. Therefore, increase in entropy in such systems is the natural direction of a spontaneous change. This, in fact is the second law of thermodynamics. Like first law of thermodynamics, second law can also be stated in several ways. The second law of thermodynamics explains why spontaneous exothermic reactions are so common. In exothermic reactions heat released by the reaction increases the disorder of the surroundings and overall entropy change is positive which makes the reaction spontaneous.
(e)
 Absolute Entropy and Third Law of 
Thermodynamics 
M
olecules of a substance may move in a 
straight line in any direction, they may spin like a top and the bonds in the molecules may stretch and compress. These motions of the molecule are called translational, rotational and vibrational motion respectively. When temperature of the system rises, these motions become more vigorous and entropy increases. On the other hand when temperature is lowered, the entropy decreases. The entropy of any pure 
crystalline substance approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This is called third law of thermodynamics. This is so because there is perfect order in a crystal at absolute zero. The statement is confined to pure crystalline solids because theoretical arguments and practical evidences have shown that entropy of solutions and super cooled liquids is not zero at 0 K. The importance of the third law lies in the fact that 
it permits the calculation of absolute values of entropy of pure substance from thermal data alone. For a pure substance, this can

We have seen how a knowledge of the sign 
and magnitude of the free energy change of a chemical reaction allows:
(
i) Prediction of the spontaneity of the 
chemical reaction.
(ii) Prediction of the useful 
work that could 
be extracted from it.
So far we have considered free energy 
changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now 
examine the free energy changes in reversible reactions.
‘Reversible’ under strict thermodynamic 
sense is a special way of carrying out a process such that system is at all times in perfect equilibrium with its surroundings. When applied to a chemical reaction, the term ‘reversible’ indicates that a given reaction can proceed in either direction simultaneously, so that a dynamic equilibrium is set up. This means that the reactions in both the directions should  
proceed with a decrease in free energy, which 
seems impossible. It is possible only if at equilibrium the free energy of the system is minimum. If it is not, the system would 
spontaneously change to configuration of lower free energy.
So, the criterion for equilibrium A + B  C + D;   is
∆
rG = 0
Gibbs energy for a reaction in which all 
reactants and products are in standard state,  ∆
rG  is related to the equilibrium constant of 
the reaction as follows:

or     ∆rG   =  – R T ln K
or     ∆rG    =  – 2.303 RT  log K                     (5.23)
We also know that
  
     (5.24)
For strongly endothermic reactions, the 
value of ∆rH may be large and positive. In 
such a case, value of K will be much smaller  
than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to 
form much product. In case of exothermic reactions, ∆
rH is large and negative, and ∆rG 
is likely to be large and negative too. In such cases, K will be much larger than 1. We may 
expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a large K, and hence can go to near completion. 
∆
rG also depends upon ∆rS, if the changes 
in the entropy of reaction is also taken into account, the value of K or extent of chemical reaction will also be affected, depending upon whether ∆
rS is positive or negative.

Thermodynamics deals with energy changes in chemical or physical processes and enables us to 
study these changes quantitatively and to make useful predictions. For these purposes, we divide the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution or absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related through the first law of thermodynamics  via ∆U = q + w. ∆U,  change in internal energy, depends 
on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and 
are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to 
these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature depends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q =  C∆T. 
Work can be measured by w = –p
ex∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we 
can put pex = p for infinitesimal changes in the volume making wrev = – p dV. In this condition, we 
can use gas equation, pV = nRT.
At constant volume, w = 0, then ∆U = qV , heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of 
chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy . 
Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure, 
∆H = qp.
There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and 
sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes 
which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be calculated using Hess’s law . Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by

and in gaseous state by
∆rH =  Σ bond enthalpies of the reactants – Σ bond enthalpies of the products
First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical 
reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems,  
∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy  for this purpose. entropy is a measure 
of disorder or randomness. For a spontan
eous change, total entropy change is positive. 
Therefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous 
change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation  
∆S = qrev
T for a reversible process. qrev
T is independent of path.
Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function  
gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and 
enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:
∆rG = ∆rH – T ∆rS
For a spontaneous change, ∆Gsys < 0 and at equilibrium, ∆Gsys = 0.
Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by
∆rG = – RT ln K.
K can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆rG which can be found from 
. Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which 
are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems 
having positive entropy of reaction.
