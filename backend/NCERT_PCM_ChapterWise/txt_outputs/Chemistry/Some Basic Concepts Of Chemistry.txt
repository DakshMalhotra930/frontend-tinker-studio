UNIT 1
SOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY
Science can be viewed as a continuing human effort to 
systematise knowledge for describing and understanding nature. You have learnt in your previous classes that we come across diverse substances present in nature and changes in them in daily life. Curd formation from milk, formation of vinegar from sugarcane juice on keeping for prolonged time and rusting of iron are some of the examples of changes which we come across many times. For the sake of convenience, science is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology, etc. The branch of science that studies the preparation, properties, structure and reactions of material substances is called chemistry.
DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY
Chemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old 
discipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather it came up as a result of search for two interesting things:
 i. Philosopher’s stone (Paras) which would convert 
all baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold.
 ii. ‘Elixir of life’ which would grant immortality.
People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied that knowledge in various walks of life. Chemistry developed mainly in the form of Alchemy and Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE. Modern chemistry took shape in the 18
th century Europe, 
after a few centuries of alchemical traditions which were introduced in Europe by the Arabs. After studying this unit, you will be 
able to
• appreciate the contribution of India 
in the development of chemistry understand the role of chemistry in different spheres of life;
• explain the characteristics of three 
states of matter;
• classify different substances 
into elements, compounds and mixtures;
• use scientific notations and 
determine significant figures;
• differentiate between precision and 
accuracy;
• define SI base units and convert 
physical quantities from one system of units to another;
• explain various laws of chemical 
combination;
• appreciate significance of atomic 
mass, average atomic mass, molecular mass and formula mass;
• describe the terms – mole and 
molar mass;
• calculate the mass per cent of 
component elements constituting a compound;
• determine empirical formula and 
molecular formula for a compound from the given experimental data; and
• perform the stoichiometric 
calculations. 
Chemistry is the science of molecules and their 
transformations. It is the science not so much of the one 
hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules that may be built from them.

chemistry
Other cultures – especially the Chinese 
and the Indian – had their own alchemical 
traditions. These included much knowledge of chemical processes and techniques.
In ancient India, chemistry was called 
Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya or 
Rasvidya. It included metallurgy, medicine, manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc. Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the story of development of chemistry in India is very old. Archaeological findings show that baked bricks were used in construction work. It shows the mass production of pottery, which can be regarded as the earliest chemical process, in which materials were mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by using fire to achieve desirable qualities. Remains of glazed pottery have been found in  Mohenjodaro. Gypsum cement has been used in the construction work. It contains lime, sand and traces of CaCO
3. Harappans made 
faience, a sort of glass which was used in ornaments. They melted and forged a variety of objects from metals, such as lead, silver, gold and copper. They improved the hardness of copper for making artefacts by using tin and arsenic. A number of glass objects were found in Maski in South India (1000–900 BCE), and  Hastinapur and Taxila in North India (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were coloured by addition of colouring agents like metal oxides.
Copper metallurgy in India dates back to 
the beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the  
subcontinent. There are much archeological evidences to support the view that technologies for extraction of copper and iron were developed indigenously.
According to Rigveda, tanning of leather 
and dying of cotton were practised during 1000–400 BCE. The golden gloss of the black polished ware of northen India could not  be replicated and is still a chemical mystery. These wares indicate the mastery with which kiln temperatures could be controlled. Kautilya’s Arthashastra describes 
the production of salt from sea.
A vast number of statements and material 
described in the ancient Vedic literature can be shown to agree with modern scientific 
findings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver 
ornaments and terracotta discs and painted grey pottery  have been found in many 
archaeological sites in north India. Sushruta 
Samhita explains the importance of Alkalies. 
The Charaka Samhita mentions ancient 
indians who knew how to prepare sulphuric acid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and zinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron and the carbonates of lead and iron.
Rasopanishada describes the preparation 
of gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also 
describe the preparation of fireworks using sulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium nitrate), mercury, camphor, etc.
Nagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He 
was a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a metallurgist. His work Rasratnakar deals with 
the formulation of mercury compounds. He has also discussed methods for the extraction of metals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A book, Rsarnavam, appeared around 800 CE. 
It discusses the uses of various furnaces, ovens and crucibles for different purposes. It describes methods by which metals could be 
identified by flame colour. 
Chakrapani discovered mercury sulphide. 
The credit for inventing soap also goes to him. 
He used mustard oil and some alkalies as ingredients for making soap. Indians began making soaps in the 18
th century CE. Oil of 
Eranda  and seeds of Mahua plant and calcium 
carbonate were used for making soap.
The paintings found on the walls of Ajanta 
and Ellora, which look fresh even after ages, testify to a high level of science achieved in ancient India. Varähmihir’s Brihat Samhita is a sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed in the sixth century CE. It informs about the preparation of glutinous material to be applied on walls and roofs of houses and temples. It was prepared entirely from extracts of various plants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were concentrated by boiling, and then, treated with various resins. It will be interesting to test such materials scientifically and assess 
them for use.

Some Ba Sic concept S of chemi Stry
A number of classical texts, like 
Atharvaveda (1000 BCE) mention some 
dye stuff, the material used were turmeric, 
madder, sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some other substances having tinting property were kamplcica, pattanga and jatuka. 
Varähmihir’s Brihat Samhita gives 
references to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes for hair dying were made from plants, like indigo and minerals like iron power, black iron or steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel. Gandhayukli describes recipes 
for making scents, mouth perfumes, bath powders, incense and talcum power.
Paper was known to India in the 17
th 
century as account of Chinese traveller I-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate that ink was used in India from the fourth century. Colours of ink were made from chalk, red lead and minimum.
It seems that the process of fermentation 
was well-known to Indians. Vedas and 
Kautilya’s Arthashastra mention about 
many types of liquors. Charaka Samhita also 
mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants, stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and sugarcane for making Asavas.
The concept that matter is ultimately 
made of indivisible building blocks, appeared in  India a few centuries BCE as a part of philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda, born in 600 BCE, originally known by the name Kashyap, was the first proponent of the ‘atomic theory’. He formulated the theory of very small indivisible particles, which he named ‘Paramãnu’ (comparable to atoms). He authored the text Vaiseshika Sutras. According to him, all substances are aggregated form of smaller units called atoms (Paramãnu), which are eternal, indestructible, 
spherical, suprasensible and in motion in the original state. He explained that this individual entity cannot be sensed through any human organ. Kanda added that there are varieties of atoms that are as different as the different classes of substances. He said these (Paramãnu) could form pairs or triplets, among other combinations and unseen forces cause interaction between them. He 
conceptualised this theory around 2500 years before John Dalton (1766-1844). 
Charaka Samhita is the oldest Ayurvedic 
epic of India. It describes the treatment of diseases. The concept of reduction of particle size of metals is clearly discussed in Charaka Samhita. Extreme reduction of particle size is termed as nanotechnology. Charaka Samhita 
describes the use of bhasma of metals in the treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been proved that bhasmas have nanoparticles 
of metals. 
After the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry 
reached a steady state, but it too declined due to the introduction and practise of western medicinal system in the 20
th century. During 
this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical industry based on Ayurveda continued to exist, but it too declined gradually. It took about 100-150 years for Indians to learn and adopt new techniques. During this time, foreign products poured in. As a result, indigenous traditional techniques gradually declined. Modern science appeared in Indian scene in the later part of the nineteenth century. By the mid-nineteenth century, European scientists started coming to India and modern chemistry started growing.
From the above discussion, you have learnt 
that chemistry deals with the composition, 
structure, properties and interection of matter and is of much use to human beings in daily life. These aspects can be best described and understood in terms of basic constituents of matter that are atoms and molecules. That is why, chemistry is also called the science of atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)? Is it possible to count the number of atoms and molecules in a given mass of matter and have a quantitative relationship between the mass and the number of these particles? We will get the answer of some of these questions in this Unit. We will further describe how physical properties of matter can be quantitatively described using numerical 
values with suitable units.

chemistry
1.1 importance  of chemi Stry
Chemistry plays a central role in 
science and 
is often intertwined with other branches of 
science.
Principles of chemistry are applicable 
in diverse areas, such as weather patterns, functioning of brain and operation of a computer, production in chemical industries, manufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts, dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents, metals, alloys, etc., including new material.
Chemistry contributes in a big way to the 
national economy. It also plays an important role in meeting human needs for food, healthcare products and other material aimed at improving the quality of life.  This is exemplified by the large-scale production of a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of pesticides and insecticides. Chemistry provides methods for the isolation of life-saving drugs from natural sources and makes possible synthesis of such drugs. Some of these drugs are cisplatin and taxol, which are effective in cancer therapy. The drug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for helping AIDS patients. 
Chemistry contributes to a large extent in 
the development and growth of a nation. With a better understanding of chemical principles it has now become possible to design and synthesise new material having specific magnetic, electric and optical properties.  This has lead to the production of superconducting ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has helped in establishing industries which manufacture utility goods, like acids, alkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These industries contribute in a big way to the economy of a nation and generate employment. 
In recent years, chemistry has helped in 
dealing with some of the pressing aspects 
of environmental degradation with a fair degree of success. Safer alternatives to environmentally hazardous refrigerants, like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible 
for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have been successfully synthesised. However, many big environmental problems continue to 
be matters of grave concern to the chemists. One such problem is the management of the Green House gases, like methane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding of biochemical processes, use of enzymes for large-scale production of chemicals and synthesis of new exotic material are some of the intellectual challenges for the future generation of chemists. A developing country, like India, needs talented and creative chemists for accepting such challenges. To be a good chemist and to accept such challanges, one needs to understand the basic concepts of chemistry, which begin with the concept of matter. Let us start with the nature of matter.
1.2
 natUre of matter
You are already familiar with the term ma
tter 
from your earlier classes. Anything which has 
mass and occupies space is called matter. 
Everything around us, for example, book, pen, pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are composed of matter. You know that they have mass and they occupy space. Let us recall the characteristics of the states of matter, which 
you learnt in your previous classes.
1.2.1
 States of matter
You are aware that matter can exist in three 
physical states viz.
 solid, liquid and gas. 
The constituent particles of matter in these three states can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1.
Particles are held very close to each other 
in solids in an orderly fashion and there is not 
much freedom of movement. In liquids, the 
particles are close to each other but they can move around. However, in gases, the particles are far apart as compared to those present in solid or liquid states and their movement is easy and fast. Because of such arrangement of particles, different states of matter exhibit 
the following characteristics:(i)
 Solids have definite volume
 and definite 
shape.
(ii) Liquids hav
e definite volume but do 
not have definite shape. They take the 
shape of the container in which they are 
placed.

Some Ba Sic concept S of chemi Stry
(iii) Gases have neither definite volume nor 
definite shape. They completely occupy 
the space in the container in which they 
are placed.
These three states of matter are 
interconvertible by changing the conditions 
of temperature and pressure.
Solid  liquid  Gas
On heating, a solid usually changes to 
a liquid, and the liquid on further heating changes to gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid on further cooling freezes to the solid.
1.2.2.	Classification
	of	Matter
In Class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that 
at 
the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can 
be classified as mixture or pure substance . 
These can be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2.
When all constituent particles of a 
substance are same in chemical nature, it is said to be a pure substance. A mixture 
contains many types of particles.
a mixture contains 
particles of two or 
more pure substances which may be present 
in it in any ratio. Hence, their composition is variable. Pure substances forming mixture are called its components. Many of the substances present around you are mixtures. 
For example, sugar solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures. A mixture may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a 
homogeneous mixture, the components Fig. 1.2  Classification of matter
Fig. 1.1  Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid 
and gaseous state
completely mix with each other. This means 
particles of components of the mixture are uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the mixture and its composition is uniform throughout. Sugar solution and air are the examples of homogeneous mixtures. In contrast to this, in a heterogeneous mixture, the composition is not uniform throughout and sometimes different components are visible. For example, mixtures of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with some dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of many more examples of mixtures which you come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention here that the components of a mixture can be separated by using physical methods, such as simple hand-picking, filtration, 
crystallisation, distillation, etc. 
pure subs
tances have characteristics 
different from mixtures. Constituent particles 
of pure substances have fixed composition. Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are some examples of pure substances. Glucose contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio and its particles are of same composition. Hence, like all other pure substances, glucose has a fixed composition. Also, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen and oxygen—cannot be separated by simple 
physical methods.
Pure substances can further be classified 
into elements and compounds. Particles 
of an element consist of only one type of 
atoms. These particles may exist as atoms or 
molecules. You may be familiar with atoms

chemistry
and molecules from the previous classes; 
however, you will be studying about them in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples of elements. Their all atoms are of one type. However, the atoms of different elements are different in nature. Some elements, such as sodium or copper, contain atoms as their constituent particles, whereas, in some others, the constituent particles are molecules which are formed by two or more atoms. For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which two atoms combine to give their respective molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.elements are present in a compound in a fixed 
and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic of a particular compound. Also, the properties of a compound are different from those of its constituent elements. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound formed by their combination i.e., water is a liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a supporter of combustion, but water is used as a fire extinguisher.

1.3.1 physical and chemical properties 
Every substance h
as unique or characteristic 
properties. These properties can be classified 
into two categories — physical properties, such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc., and chemical properties,  
like composition, combustibility, ractivity with acids and bases, etc.
physical properties can be measured 
or observed without changing the identity
 
or the composition of the substance. The measurement or observation of chemical 
properties requires a chemical change to 
occur. Measurement of physical properties does not require occurance of a chemical change. The examples of chemical properties are characteristic reactions of different substances; these include acidity or basicity, combustibility, etc. Chemists describe, interpret and predict the behaviour of substances on the basis of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, which are determined by careful measurement and experimentation. In the following section, we When two or more atoms of  different 
elements combine together in a definite ratio, 
the molecule of a compound is obtained. 
Moreover, the constituents of a compound cannot be separated into simpler substances by physical methods. They can be separated by chemical methods. Examples of some compounds are water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc. The molecules of water and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig. 1.4.
Note that a water molecule comprises 
two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide contains two oxygen atoms combined with 
one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different  Fig. 1.4  A depiction of molecules of water and

will learn about the  measurement of physical 
properties.
1.3.2 measurement of physical properties
Quantitative measurement of properties is 
reaquired 
for scientific investigation. Many 
properties of matter, such as length, area, volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any quantitative observation or measurement is represented by a number followed by units in which it is measured. For example, length of a room can be represented as  6 m; here, 6 is the number and m denotes metre, the unit in which the length is measured.
Earlier, two different systems of 
measurement, i.e., the 
english System 
and the metric System were being used
 
in different parts of the world. The metric system, which originated in France in late eighteenth century, was more convenient as it was based on the decimal system. Late, need of a common standard system was felt by the scientific community. Such a system was established in 1960 and is discussed in detail below.
1.3.3
 the international System of Units (S i)
The International System of Units (in 
French Le Systeme International 
d’Unités 
— abbreviated as SI) was established by the 11
th General Conference on Weights and 
Measures (CGPM from Conference Generale 
des Poids et Measures). The CGPM is an inter-governmental treaty organisation created by a 
diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention, which was signed in Paris in 1875.
the Si system has seven 
base units  
and they are listed in Table 1.1. These units pertain to the seven fundamental scientific quantities. The other physical quantities, such as speed, volume, density, etc., can be derived from these quantities. maintaining the national  
Standards of measurement
The system of units, including unit 
definitions, keeps on changing with time. Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a particular unit was enhanced substantially by adopting new principles, member nations of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed to change the formal definition of that unit. Each modern industrialised country, including India, has a National Metrology Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of measurements.  This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi. This laboratory establishes experiments to realise the base units and 
derived units of measurement and maintains National Standards of Measurement. These standards are periodically inter-compared with standards maintained at other National Metrology Institutes in the world, as well as those, established at the International Bureau of Standards in Paris.

These prefixes are listed in Table 1.3.
Let us now quickly go through some of 
the quantities which you will be often using 
in this book.The definitions of the SI base units are 
given in Table 1.2.
The SI system allows the use of prefixes to 
indicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit.  
Table	1.2		Definitions 	of	SI	Base	Units

Fig. 1.5   Analytical balance
1.3.4 mass and Weight
mass of a substance is the amount of matter 
present in it, while weight is the force
 
exerted by gravity on an object. The mass of 
a substance is constant, whereas, its weight may vary from one place to another due to change in gravity. You should be careful in using these terms.
The mass of a substance can be determined 
accurately in the laboratory by using an 
analytical balance (Fig. 1.5). 
The SI unit of mass as given in Table 1.1 is 
kilogram. However, its fraction named as gram  
(1 kg = 1000 g), is used in laboratories due to the smaller amounts of chemicals used in 
chemical reactions.
1.3.5 
volume
Volume is the amont of space occupied by a 
substance. It has the units of 
(length)3. So in SI system, volume has units of m3. But again, 
in chemistry laboratories, smaller volumes are used. Hence, volume is often denoted in cm
3 or dm3 units.
A common unit, litre (L) which is not an 
SI unit, is used for measurement of volume 
of liquids.
1 L = 1000 mL,  1000 cm3 = 1 dm3
Fig. 1.6 helps to visualise these relations.

In the laboratory, the volume of liquids 
or solutions can be measured by graduated 
cylinder, burette, pipette, etc. A volumetric flask  is used to prepare a known volume of a solution. These measuring devices are shown in Fig. 1.7.

Many a time 
in the study of chemistry, one 
has to deal with experimental data as well as theoretical calculations. There are meaningful ways to handle the numbers conveniently and fahrenheit) and K (kelvin). Here, K is the 
SI unit. The thermometers based on these scales are shown in Fig. 1.8. Generally, the thermometer with celsius scale are calibrated from 0° to 100°, where these two temperatures are the freezing point and the boiling point of water, respectively. The fahrenheit scale is represented between 32° to 212°. 
The temperatures on two scales are 
related to each other by the following relationship:
/unif0b0/unif03d /unif0b0/unif02b/unif028/unif029 FC9
532 
The kelvin scale is related to celsius scale 
as follows:
K = °C + 273.15
It is interesting to note that temperature 
below 0 °C (i.e., negative values) are possible 
in Celsius scale but in Kelvin scale, negative temperature is not possible.
Fig. 1.8  Thermometers using different 
temperature scales1.3.6  Density
The two properties — mass and volume 
discussed above are related as follows:
=MassDensityVolume
Density of a substance is its amount of mass 
per unit volume. So, SI units of density can be obtained as follows:
SI unit of density = 
                          = kg
m3 or kg m–3
This unit is quite large and a chemist often 
expresses density in g cm–3, where mass is 
expressed in gram and volume is expressed 
in cm3. Density of a substance tells us about 
how closely its particles are packed. If density is more, it means particles are more closely 
packed.

and are present in extremely large numbers,  a chemist has to deal with numbers as large as 602, 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the molecules of 2 g of hydrogen gas or as small as 0.00000000000000000000000166 g mass of a H atom. Similarly, other constants such as Planck’s constant, speed of light, charges on particles, etc., involve numbers of the above magnitude.
It may look funny for a moment to 
write or count numbers involving so many zeros but it offers a real challenge to do simple mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division with such numbers. You can write any two numbers of the above type and try any one of the operations you like to accept as a challenge, and then, you will really appreciate the difficulty in handling such numbers.
This problem is solved by using scientific 
notation for such numbers, i.e., exponential notation in which any number can be represented in the form N ×
 10n, where n is an 
exponent having positive or negative values and N is a number (called digit term) which varies between 1.000... and 9.999....
Thus, we can write 232.508 as  
2.32508 ×
 102 in scientific notation. Note that 
while writing it, the decimal had to be moved to the left by two places and same is the exponent (2) of 10 in the scientific notation.
Similarly, 0.00016 can be written as  
1.6 ×
 10–4. Here, the decimal has to be 
moved four places to the right and (–4) is the exponent in the scientific notation.
While performing mathematical operations 
on numbers expressed in scientific notations, the following points are to be kept in mind.reference Standard
After defining a unit of measurement such as 
the kilogram or the metre, scientists agreed on reference standards that make it possible to calibrate all measuring devices. For getting reliable measurements, all devices such as metre sticks and analytical balances have been calibrated by their manufacturers to give correct readings. However, each of these devices is standardised or calibrated against some reference. The mass standard is the kilogram since 1889. It has been defined as the mass of platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir) cylinder that is stored in an airtight jar at International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France. Pt-Ir was chosen for this standard because it is highly resistant to chemical attack and its mass will not change for an extremely long time. 
Scientists are in search of a new 
standard for mass. This is being attempted through accurate determination of Avogadro constant. Work on this new standard focuses on ways to measure accurately the number of atoms in a well-defined mass of sample. One such method, which uses X-rays to determine the atomic density of a crystal of ultrapure silicon, has an accuracy of about 1 part in 10
6  but has not yet been adopted to 
serve as a standard. There are other methods but none of them are presently adequate to replace the Pt-Ir cylinder. No doubt, changes are expected within this decade. 
The metre was originally defined as the 
length between two marks on a Pt-Ir bar kept at a temperature of 0°C (273.15 K).  In 1960 the length of the metre was defined as 1.65076373
 × 106 times the wavelength of 
light emitted by a krypton laser. Although this was a cumbersome number, it preserved the length of the metre at its agreed value. The metre was redefined in 1983 by CGPM as the length of path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. Similar to the length and the mass, there are reference standards for other physical quantities.

Multiplication and Division
These two operations follow the same rules 
which are there for exponential numbers, i.e.mass obtained by an analytical balance is 
slightly higher than the mass obtained by using a platform balance. Therefore, digit 4 placed after decimal in the measurement by platform balance is uncertain. 
The uncertainty in the experimental 
or the calculated values is indicated by mentioning the number of significant figures. Significant
	figures are meaningful 
digits which are known with certainty plus one whi
ch is estimated or uncertain. The 
uncertainty is indicated by writing the certain digits and the last uncertain digit. Thus, if we write a result as 11.2 mL, we say the 11 is certain and 2 is uncertain and the uncertainty would be +1 in the last digit. Unless otherwise 
stated, an uncertainty of +1 in the last digit is always understood. 
There are certain rules for determining 
the number of significant figures. These are stated below:(1)
 All non-zero digits are 
significant. For 
example in 285 cm, there are three significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there are two significant figures.
(2)
 Zeros preceding to first 
non-zero digit 
are not significant. Such zero indicates the position of decimal point. Thus, 0.03 has one significant figure and 0.0052 has two significant figures.
(3)
 Zeros between two non-zero digits are significant. 
Thus, 2.005 has four 
significant figures.
(4) Zeros at the end 
or right of a number 
are significant, provided they are on the right side of the decimal point. For example, 0.200 g has three significant figures. But, if otherwise, the terminal zeros are not significant if there is no decimal point. For example, 100 has only one significant figure, but 100 has three significant figures and 100.0 has four significant figures. Such numbers are better represented in scientific notation. We can express the number 100 as 1×10
2 for one significant figure, 
1.0×102 for two significant figures and 
1.00×102 for three significant figures.Addition and Subtraction 
For these two operations, first the numbers are 
written in such a way that they have the same exponent. After that, the coefficients (digit terms) are added or subtracted as the case may be.
Thus, for  adding  6.65×10
4  and  8.95×103, 
exponent is made same for both the numbers. 
Thus, we get (6.65×104) + (0.895×104)
Then, these numbers can be added as follows  (6.65 + 0.895)×10
4 = 7.545×104
Similarly, the subtraction of two numbers can be done as shown below:
(2.5 × 10
–2) – (4.8 ×10–3)
 = (2.5 ×  10–2) – (0.48 ×  10–2) 
 = (2.5 – 0.48)×10–2 = 2.02 ×  10–2

Every experimental measurement has
 
some amount of uncertainty associated 
with it because of limitation of measuring instrument and the skill of the person making the measurement. For example, mass of an object is obtained using a platform balance and it comes out to be 9.4g. On measuring the mass of this object on an analytical balance, the mass obtained is 9.4213g.

Some Ba Sic concept S of chemi Stry
(5) Counting the numbers of object, for 
example, 2 balls 
or 20 eggs, have infinite 
significant figures as these are exact numbers and can be represented by writing infinite number of zeros after placing a decimal i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 
20 = 20.000000. 
In numbers written in scientific notation, 
all digits are significant e.g., 4.01×10
2 has 
three significant figures, and 8.256×10–3 has 
four significant figures.
However, one would always like the results 
to be precise and accurate. Precision and 
accuracy are often referred to while we talk 
about the measurement.
precision  refers to the closeness of 
various measurements for the same quantity. 
H
owever, accuracy is the agreement of a 
particular value to the true value of the result. For example, if the true value for a result is 2.00 g and student ‘A’ takes two measurements and reports the results as 1.95 g and 1.93 g. These values are precise as they are close to each other but are not accurate. Another student ‘B’ repeats the experiment and obtains 1.94 g and 2.05 g as the results for two measurements. These observations are neither precise nor accurate. When the third student ‘C’ repeats these measurements and reports 2.01 g and 1.99 g as the result, these values are both precise and accurate. This can be more clearly understood from the data given in Table 1.4.

The result cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than either of the original numbers. 
 12.11
   18.0
   1.012
   31.122Here, 
18.0 has only one digit after the decimal 
point and the result should be reported only up to one digit after the decimal point, which is 31.1.
Multiplication and Division of Significant Figures
In these operations, the result must be 
reported with no more significant figures as in the measurement with the few significant figures.
2.5×1.25 = 3.125
Since 2.5 has two significant figures, 
the result should not have more than two 
significant figures, thus, it is 3.1.
While limiting the result to the required 
number of significant figures as done in the above mathematical operation, one has to keep in mind the following points for rounding 
off the numbers 
1.
 If the rightmost digit to be removed is more than 5, 
the preceding number is 
increased by one. For example, 1.386. If we have to remove 6, we have to round it to 1.39.
2.
 If the rightmost digit to be removed is less than 5, the preceding number is not
 
changed. For example, 4.334 if 4 is to be removed, then the result is rounded upto 4.33.
3.
 If the rightmost digit 
to be removed is 5, 
then the preceding number is not changed if it is an even number but it is increased by one if it is an odd number. For example, if 6.35 is to be rounded by removing 5, we have to increase 3 to 4 giving 6.4 as the result. However, if 6.25 is to be rounded off it is rounded off to 6.2.
1.4.3
 Dimensional analysis
Often while calculating, there is a need to 
convert units from one system 
to the other. 
The method used to accomplish this is called factor label method or unit factor method or dimensional analysis. This is illustrated 
below.

the above case) which gives the desired units 
i.e., the numerator should have that part which  is required in the desired result.
It should also be noted in the above 
example that units can be handled just like other numerical part. It can be cancelled, divided, multiplied, squared, etc. Let us study one more example.

1.5 laWS of chemical 
comBination S
The combination of elements 
to form compounds is governed by the 
following five 
basic laws.
1.5.1  law of conservation 
of mass 
This law was put forth by 
Antoine Lavoisier 
in 1789. He performed careful experimental 
studies for combustion reactions and reached to the conclusion that in all physical and chemical changes, there is no net change in mass duting the process. Hence, he reached to the conclusion that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. This is called ‘Law of Conservation of Mass’. This law formed the basis for several later developments in chemistry. Infact, this was the result of exact measurement of masses of reactants and products, and carefully planned experiments performed by Lavoisier.

are produced in a chemical 
reaction they do so in a simple ratio by volume, provided all gases are at  
the same temperature and pressure.
Thus, 100 mL of hydrogen 
combine with 50 mL of oxygen to give 100 mL of water vapour.
Hydrogen  + Oxygen →  Water
100 mL          50 mL        100 mLThus, the volumes of hydrogen and 
oxygen which combine (i.e., 100 mL and  
50 mL) bear a simple ratio of 2:1.
Gay Lussac’s discovery of integer ratio 
in volume relationship is actually the law of 
definite proportions by volume. The law of definite proportions, stated earlier, was with respect to mass. The Gay Lussac’s law was explained properly by the work of Avogadro in 1811.
1.5.5
 avogadro’s law
In 1811, Avogadro 
proposed that equal 
volumes of all gases at the same temperature 
and pressure should contain equal number of molecules. Avogadro made a distinction between atoms and molecules which is 
quite understandable in present times. If we consider again the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, we see that two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water without leaving any unreacted oxygen.
Note that in the Fig. 1.9 (Page 16) each 
box contains equal number of 
molecules. In fact, Avogadro could explain the above result by considering the molecules to be polyatomic. If hydrogen and oxygen were considered as diatomic as recognised 
now, then the above results are easily understandable. However, Dalton and others believed at that time that atoms of the same kind 1.5.2
		Law	of	Definite 	Proportions
This law was given by, a 
French chemist, 
Joseph 
Proust. He stated that a given 
compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by weight.
Proust worked with two 
samples of cupric carbonate — one of which was of natural origin and the other was synthetic. He found that the composition of elements present in it was same for both the samples as shown below:
% of 
copper% of 
carbon% of 
oxygen
Natural Sample
Synthetic Sample51.3551.359.749.7438.9138.91
Thus, he concluded that irrespective of the 
source, a given compound always contains 
same elements combined together in the same proportion by mass. The validity of this law has been confirmed by various experiments. It is sometimes also referred to as 
law of
 
Definite 	Compositio n.
1.5.3  law of multiple proportions
This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803. According to this law, if two elements can combine to form more than one compound,
 
the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element, are in the ratio of small whole numbers.
For example, hydrogen combines with 
oxygen to form two compounds, namely, water and hydrogen peroxide.
Hydrogen + Oxygen → Water
 2g              16g            18g
Hydrogen + Oxygen → Hydrogen Peroxide
 2g              32g             34g
Here, the masses of oxygen (i.e., 16 g and 32 g), 
which combine with 
a fixed mass of hydrogen 
(2g) bear a simple ratio, i.e., 16:32 or 1: 2.

cannot combine and molecules of oxygen or 
hydrogen containing two atoms did not exist. Avogadro’s proposal was published in the French Journal de Physique. In spite of being 
correct, it did not gain much support.
After about 50 years, in 1860, the first 
international conference on chemistry was held in Karlsruhe, Germany, to resolve various ideas. At the meeting, Stanislao Cannizaro presented a sketch of a course of chemical philosophy, which emphasised on the importance of Avogadro’s work.
1.6
 Dalton’ S atomic theory
Although the origin 
of the idea that matter is 
composed of small indivisible particles called 
‘a-tomio’ (meaning, indivisible), dates back to the time of Democritus, a Greek Philosopher (460–370 BC), it again started emerging as a result of several experimental studies which led to the laws mentioned above.
In 1808, Dalton published 
‘A New System of Chemical Philosophy’, in which he proposed the following :1.
 Matter consists of indivisible atoms.
2. All atoms of a given element have identical pro
perties, including identical mass. Atoms 
of different elements differ in mass.
3. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements 
combine in a fixed ratio.
4. Chemical reactions involve reorganisation
 
of atoms. These are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.Dalton’s theory could explain the laws 
of chemical combination. However, it could 
not explain the laws of gaseous volumes. It could not provide the reason for combining of atoms, which was answered later by other 
scientists.

After having some idea about the terms 
atoms and molecules, it is appropriate here to understand what do 
we mean by atomic 
and molecular masses.
1.7.1  atomic mass 
The atomic mass or the mass of an atom is 
ac
tually very-very small because atoms are 
extremely small. Today, we have sophisticated techniques e.g., mass spectrometry for determining the atomic masses fairly accurately. But in the nineteenth century, scientists could determine the mass of one atom relative to another by experimental 
means, as has been mentioned earlier. Hydrogen, being the lightest atom was arbitrarily assigned a mass of 1 (without any units) and other elements were assigned masses relative to it. However, the present system of atomic masses is based on carbon-12 as the standard and has been agreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon-12 is one of the isotopes of carbon and can be 
represented as 
12C. In this system, 12C is 
assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass unit (amu) and masses of all other atoms are given relative to this standard. One atomic mass unit is defined as a mass exactly equal to one-twelfth of the mass of one carbon – 12 atom.

Similarly, the mass of oxygen - 16 (16O) 
atom would be 15.995 amu.
At present, ‘amu’ has been replaced by 
‘u’, which is known as unified	mass.
When we 
use atomic masses of elements 
in calculations, we actually use average 
atomic masses of elements, which are explained below.
1.7.2
 average atomic mass
Many naturally occurring elements exist 
as more than one isotope. When we take into account the existence of these isotopes and their relative abundance (per cent
 
occurrence), the average atomic mass of that element can be computed. For example,  carbon has the following three isotopes with relative abundances and masses as shown against each of them.

Similarly, average atomic masses for 
other elements can be calculated. In the 
periodic table of elements, the atomic masses mentioned for different elements actually 
represent their average atomic masses.1.7.3
 molecular mass
Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses 
of 
the elements present in a molecule. It is 
obtained by multiplying the atomic mass of each element by the number of its atoms and adding them together. For example, molecular mass of methane, which contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, can be obtained as follows:
Molecular mass of methane,  (CH
4) = (12.011 u) + 4 (1.008 u) 
= 16.043 uSimilarly, molecular mass of water (H

mass of oxygen= 2 (1.008 u) + 16.00 u= 18.02 u

Some substances, such as sodium chloride, 
do 
not contain discrete molecules as their 
constituent units. In such compounds, positive (sodium ion) and negative (chloride ion) entities are arranged in a three-dimensional structure, as shown in Fig. 1.10.
It may be noted that in sodium chloride, 
one Na
+ ion is surrounded by six Cl– ion and 
vice-versa.
The formula, such as NaCl, is used to 
calculate the formula mass instead of 
molecular mass as in the solid state sodium chloride does not exist as a single entity.Fig. 1.10  Packing of  Na+ and Cl– ions

This number of entities in 1 mol is so 
important that it is given a separate name and

Atoms and molecules are extremely small 
in size 
and their numbers in even a small 
amount of any substance is really very large. To handle such large numbers, a unit of convenient magnitude is required.
Just as we denote one dozen for 12 items, 
score for 20 items, gross for 144 items, we use the idea of mole to count entities at the microscopic level (i.e., atoms, molecules, particles, electrons, ions, etc). 
In SI system, mole (symbol, mol) was 
introduced as seventh base quantity for the amount of a substance.
The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of 
amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.02214076 ×
 1023 elementary entities. 
This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N
A, when expressed 
in the unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro 
number. The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles. It may be emphasised that the mole of a substance always contains the same number of entities, no matter what the substance may be. In order to determine this number precisely, the mass of a carbon–12 atom was determined by a mass spectrometer and found to be equal to 1.992648 ×
 10–23 g. 
Knowing that one mole of carbon weighs 12 g,

you would ask is:  what is its formula or what 
are its constituents and in what ratio are they present in the given compound? For known compounds also, such information provides a check  whether the given sample contains the same percentage of elements as present in a pure sample. In other words, one can check the purity of a given sample by analysing this data.
Let us understand it by taking the example 
of water (H
2O). Since water contains hydrogen 
and oxygen, the percentage composition of both these elements can be calculated as follows:
Mass % of an element = 
mass of that element in the compo und  100

Molar mass of water     = 18.02 g

Mass % of oxygen         =  16.00

                  =   88.79
Let us take one more example. What is the 
percentage of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen 
in ethanol?
Molecular formula of ethanol is:  C2H5OH 
Molar mass of ethanol is:
(2×12.01 + 6×1.008 + 16.00) g =  46.068 gMass per cent of carbon 
  
= 24.02 g
46.068 g100×  = 52.14%
Mass per cent of hydrogen

46.068 g100×  = 13.13%
Mass per cent of oxygen   
= 16.00 g
46.068 g100×  = 34.73%
After understanding the calculation of  
per cent of mass, let us now see what 
information can be obtained from the  
per cent composition data.1.9.1  empirical formula for molecular

An empirical formula represents the simplest 
whole number ratio of various atoms present 
i
n a compound, whereas, the molecular 
formula shows the exact number of different types of atoms present in a molecule of a compound.
If the mass per cent of various elements 
present in a compound is known, its empirical 
formula can be determined. Molecular formula can  further be obtained if the molar mass is known. The following example illustrates  
this sequence.

A compound contains 4.07% 
hydrogen, 
24.27% carbon and 71.65% chlorine. 
Its molar mass is 98.96 g. What are its empirical and molecular formulas?
Solution
Step 1. 
conversion of mass per cent 
to grams
Since we are having mass per cent, it is 
convenient 
to use 100 g of the compound 
as the starting material. Thus, in the  
100 g sample of the above compound, 4.07g hydrogen, 24.27g carbon and 71.65g chlorine are present.
Step 2.

equation of a given reaction. Let us consider 
the combustion of methane. A balanced equation for this reaction is as given below:
CH
4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)
Here, methane and dioxygen are called reactants and carbon dioxide and water are 
called products. Note that all the reactants 
and the products are gases in the above reaction and this has been indicated by letter (g) in the brackets next to its formula. Similarly, in case of solids and liquids, (s) and (l) are written respectively.
The coefficients 2 for O
2 and H2O are 
called stoichiometric coefficients. Similarly the coefficient for CH
4 and CO2 is one in each 
case. They represent the number of molecules (and moles as well) taking part in the reaction or formed in the reaction.
Thus, according to the above chemical 
reaction,
•	One mole of CH4(g) reacts with two moles 
of O2(g) to give one mole of CO2(g) and  
two moles of H2O(g)
•	One molecule of CH4(g) reacts with  
2 molecules of O2(g) to give one molecule 
of CO2(g) and 2 molecules of H2O(g)
•	22.7 L of CH4(g) reacts with 45.4 L of O2 
(g) to give 22.7 L of CO2 (g) and 45.4 L of 
H2O(g)
•	16 g of CH4 (g) reacts with 2×32 g of O2 
(g) to give 44 g of CO2 (g) and 2×18 g of  
H2O (g).
From these relationships, the given data can be interconverted as follows:

The word ‘st
oichiometry’ is derived from 
two Greek words — stoicheion (meaning, 
element) and metron (meaning, measure). 
Stoichiometry,  thus, deals with the calculation of masses (sometimes volumes also) of the reactants and the products involved in a chemical reaction. Before understanding how to calculate the amounts of reactants required or the products produced in a chemical reaction, let us study what information is available from the balanced chemical Step 3. Divide each of the mole values obtained above by the smallest number amongst them
Since 2.021 is smallest value, division 
by it gives a ratio of 2:1:1 for H:C:Cl.
In case the ratios are not whole numbers, 
then they may be converted into whole number by multiplying by the suitable coefficient.
Step 4. Write down the empirical 
formula by mentioning the numbers after writing the symbols of respective elements
CH
2Cl  is, thus, the empirical formula 
of the above compound.
Step 5. Writing molecular formula
(a) Determine empirical formula mass by 
adding the atomic masses of various atoms present in the empirical formula.For CH
2Cl, empirical formula mass is 
12.01 + (2 ×1.008) + 35.453
= 49.48 g
(b) Divide Molar mass by empirical 
formula mass
                                             = 2 = ( n)
(c) Multiply empirical formula by n obtained above to get the molecular formula
Empirical formula = CH
2Cl, n = 2. Hence 
molecular formula is C2H4Cl2.

reactant which is present in the least amount 
gets consumed after sometime and after that further reaction does not take place whatever be the amount of the other reactant. Hence, the reactant, which gets consumed first, limits the amount of product formed and is, therefore, called the limiting reagent.
In performing stoichiometric calculations, 
this aspect is also to be kept in mind.
1.10.2  reactions in Solutions
A majority of reactions in the laboratories 
are carried out in solutions. Therefore, it is important to understand as how the amount 
of substance is expressed when it is present in the solution. The concentration of a solution or the amount of substance present in its  
given volume can be expressed in any of the 
following ways.

 Mass per cent or weight per cent (w/w %)
2. Mole fraction
3. Molarity
4. Molality
Let us now study each one of them in 
detail.
Balancing a chemical equation
According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of 
atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides 
  4 Fe(s)  +  3O2(g)  → 2Fe2O3(s)  (a) balanced equation
  2 Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  → 2MgO(s)   (b) balanced equation
  P4(s)   +  O2 (g)  → P4O10(s)  (c) unbalanced equation
Equations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on each side of the equations. However equation (c) 
is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus 
atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the right side of the equation.
  P4(s)  +  5O2(g)  → P4O10(s)  balanced equation          
Now, let us take combustion of propane, C3H8. This equation can be balanced in steps.
Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.
  C3H8(g)  +  O2(g) → CO2 (g) + H2O(l)   unbalanced equation
Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms:  Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three 
CO2 molecules are required on the right side.
      C3H8 (g)  +  O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + H2O (l)
Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants 
however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.
  C3H8  (g) +O2 (g)  → 3CO2  (g)+4H2O (l)
Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms:  There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in 
CO2 and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO2 
and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen 
atoms.
  C3H8 (g) +5O2   (g)  →  3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)
Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The 
equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always 
remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance an equation.

problem 1.3
Calculat
e the amount of water (g) 
produced by the combustion of 16 g  
of methane.
Solution
The balanced equation for the 
combustion of methane is :
CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)
(i) 16 g of CH4   corresponds to one mole.
(ii) From the above equation, 1 mol of  
CH4 (g) gives 2 mol of H2O (g). 
2 mol of water (H2O) = 2×(2+16)  
                  = 2×18 = 36 g
1 mol H2O = 18 g H2O ⇒18gHO

4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)
44g CO2 (g) is obtained from 16 g CH4 (g).

3.  Molarity
It is the most widely used unit and is denoted 
by M. It is defined as the number of moles of the solute in 1 litre of the solution. Thus,
Molarity (M) 
=No. of moles of sol ute
 of s olution in litre s Volume
Suppose, we have 1 M solution of a 
substance, say NaOH, and we want to prepare 
a 0.2 M solution from it.
1 M NaOH means 1 mol of NaOH present 
in 1 litre of the solution. For 0.2 M solution, we require 0.2 moles of NaOH dissolved in 1 litre solution.
Hence, for making 0.2M solution from 1M 
solution, we have to take that volume of 1M NaOH solution, which contains 0.2 mol of NaOH and dilute the solution with water to 1 litre.
Now, how much volume of concentrated 
(1M) NaOH solution be taken, which contains 0.2 moles of NaOH can be calculated as follows:
If 1 mol is present in 1L or 1000 mL 
solution
then, 0.2 mol is present in 
 1000
102mL
molmolsolutio n ×.
  = 200 mL solution
Thus, 200 mL of 
1M NaOH are taken and 
enough water is added to dilute it to make it 1 litre.
In fact for such calculations, a general 
formula, M1×V1 =  M2 × V2 where M and V are 
molarity and volume, respectively, can be used. In this case, M
1 is equal to 0.2M; V1 = 1000 
mL and, M2 = 1.0M; V2 is to be calculated. 
Substituting the values in the formula:
0.2 M × 1000 mL = 1.0 M × V2
Note that the number of moles of solute  
(NaOH) was 0.2 in 200 mL and it has remained the same, i.e.,  0.2 even after dilution ( in 1000 mL) as we have changed just the amount of solvent (i.e., water) and have not done anything with respect to NaOH. But keep in mind the concentration.1.  Mass per cent

particular component to the total number of moles of the solution. If a substance ‘A’ dissolves in substance ‘B’ and their number

A and nB, respectively, then the 
mole fractions of A and B are given as: = 3.30×103×17 g NH3 (g)

Summary
Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India, 
already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life. 
The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere 
of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states – solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type, 
which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or 
more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many of the substances present around us are mixtures.
When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The 
quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English Problem 1.8

Often in a chemistry laboratory, a 
solution of a desired concentration is prepared by diluting a solution of known higher concentration. The solution of higher concentration is also known as stock solution. Note that the molality of a solution does not change with temperature since mass remains unaffected with temperature.Problem 1.7

and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to 
have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units (International System of Units).
Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain 
amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide range of 10
–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific 	
notation is used. 
The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant 	
figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express the 
measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert 
the results from one system of units to another.
The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination 
— these being the law of conservation of mass, Law	of	Definite 	Proportions, 	Law	of	
multiple proportions, Gay lussac’s law of Gaseous volumes and avogadro law. All 
these laws led to the 
Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks 
of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon, 
which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound and its molecular mass. 
The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are 
expressed in the terms of  
avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the 
respective particles or entities.
Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and 
compounds. A balanced  chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients 
indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.
