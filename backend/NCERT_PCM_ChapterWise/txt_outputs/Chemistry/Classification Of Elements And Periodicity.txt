The Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept 
in chemistry, both in principle and in practice. It is the everyday support for students, it suggests new avenues of research to professionals, and it provides a succinct organization of the whole of chemistry. It is a remarkable demonstration of the fact that the chemical elements are not a random cluster of entities but instead display trends and lie together in families. An awareness of the Periodic Table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements.

In this Unit, we will study the historical development of the Periodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic Law.
	We	will	also	learn	how	the	periodic	classification 	
fol
lows as a logical consequence of the electronic 
configuration 	of	atoms.	Finally,	we	shall	examine	some	of	
the 
periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties 
of the elements.
3.1 WHy do WE nEEd to Classify  ElEmEnts ?
We know by now that the elements are the basic units of 
all
 types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. 
By	
	1865,	the	number	of	identified	elements	had	more	than	
doubled to 63. 
At present 114 elements are known. Of 
them, the recently discovered elements are man-made. Efforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With such
	a	large	number	of	elements	it	is	very	difficult	to	
study 
individually the chemistry of all these elements and 
their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out this problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to organise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not only that it would rationalize known chemical facts about elements, but even predict new ones for undertaking further study.

Classification 	of	elements	into	groups	and	
dev
elopment of Periodic Law and Periodic 
Table are the consequences of systematising 
the knowledge gained by a number of scientists through their observations and experiments. The German chemist, Johann Dobereiner
	in	earl
y	1800’s	was	the	firs
t	to	
consider the idea of trends among properties of elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity among the physical and chemical properties of several grou
ps of three elements ( tri
ads). In 
each case, he noticed that the middle  element  of each of the 
triads
 had an atomic weight 
about half way between the atomic weights of the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties of the middle element were in between those of the other two
 members.
 Since Dobereiner’s the periodic recurrence of properties. This also did not attract much attention. The English chemist, John Alexander Newlands in 1865 profounded the 
law of octaves
. He 
arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the first
	element	(Table	3.2).	The	relationship 	was	
just like every eighth note that resembles the first
	in	octaves	of	music.	Newlands’s 	Law	of	
Octaves seemed to 
be true only for elements 
up to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, was later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the Royal Society, London.
The Periodic Law, as we know it today 
owes its development to the Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the German chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).

med to work only for a few elements, it was  
dismissed as coincidence. The next reported 
attempt to classify elements was made by a French
	geologist, 	A.E.B.	de	Chancourtois 	in	
1862. He arranged the then known elements in order of increasing atomic weights and m
ade a cylindrical table of elements to display Working independently, both the chemists in 1869 proposed that on arranging elements in  
the increasing order of their atomic weights, similarities appear in physical and chemical properties at regular intervals. Lothar Meyer plotted the physical properties such as atomic volume, melting point and boiling point against atomic weight and obtained 
Unit 3.indd   75 9/9/2022   4:36:12 PM

chemistry
a periodically repeated pattern. Unlike 
Newlands, Lothar Meyer observed a change in length of that repeating pattern. By 1868, Lothar Meyer had developed a table of the elements that closely resembles the Modern Periodic Table. However, his work was not published until after the work of Dmitri Mendeleev, the scientist who is generally credited with the development of the Modern Periodic Table.
While Dobereiner initiated the study of 
periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who was responsible for publishing the Periodic Law
	for	the	first	time.	It	states	as	follows	:
The 
properties of the elements are 
a periodic function of their atomic weights.
Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal rows and vertical columns of a table in order of their increasing atomic weights in such a way that the elements with similar properties occupied the same vertical column or group. Mendeleev’s system of classifying elements was more elaborate than that of Lothar Meyer’s.
	He	fully	recognized 	the	significance 	
of
 periodicity and used broader range of 
physical and chemical properties to classify the elements. In particular, Mendeleev relied on the similarities in the empirical formulas and properties of the compounds formed by the elements. He realized that some of the elements
	did	not	fit	in	wi
th	his	scheme	of	classification 	if	the	order	of	atomic	weight	
was 
strictly followed. He ignored the order 
of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic 
measurements might be incorrect, and placed the elements with similar properties together. For
	example,	iodine	with	lower	atomic	weight	
than that of 
tellurium (Group VI) was placed 
in	Group	VII	along	with	fluorine,	chlorine,	
bromine because of simila
rities in properties 
(Fig.	3.1).	At	the	same	time,	keeping	his	
primary 
aim of arranging the elements of 
similar properties in the same group, he proposed that some of the elements were still undiscovered and, therefore, left several gaps
	in	the	table.	For	example,	both	gallium	
and germanium were 
unknown at the time 
Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. He left the gap under aluminium and a gap under silicon, and called these elements Eka-
al
uminium and Eka- sil
icon. Mendeleev 
predicted not only the existence of gallium and germanium, but also described some of their general physical properties.  These elements were discovered later. Some of the properties predicted by Mendeleev for these elements and those found experimentally are listed in  
Table 3.3. 
The boldness of Mendeleev’s quantitative 
predictions and their eventual success made him and his Periodic Table famous. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table published in 1905 is
	shown	in	Fig.	3.1.

We 
must bear in mind that when Mendeleev 
developed his Periodic table
, chemists 
knew nothing about the internal structure 
of atom. However, the beginning of the 20th 
century witnessed profound developments in theories about sub-atomic particles. In 
1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley observed regularities in the characteristic X-ray spectra of the elements. A plot of 
 
(where 	is frequency of X- rays emitted) 
against atomic number ( Z) gave a straight 
line and not the plot of  vs atomic mass. 
He thereby showed that the atomic number 
is a more fundamental property of an element than its atomic mass. 
mendeleev’s 
Periodic 
law	was
,	the
refore,	acc
ordingly	mo
dified.	This	
is known 
as the modern Periodic law
 and 
can	be	stated	as	:
The physical and chemical properties
 
of the elements are periodic functions 
of their atomic numbers.
The Periodic law
 revealed important 
analogies among the 94 naturally occurring elements (neptunium and plutonium like actinium and protoactinium are also found in pitch blende – an ore of uranium). It stimulated renewed interest in Inorganic Chemistry and has carried into the present with the creation of artificially produced short-lived elements.
You may recall that the atomic number 
is equal to the nuclear charge (i.e., number 
of protons) or the number of electrons in a neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize the
	signi
ficance	of	quantum 	number
s	and	
electronic 	configurations 	in	periodicity 	of	
elem
ents. In fact, it is now recognized that the 
Periodic Law is essentially the consequence of the periodic variation in electronic configurations,
	which	indeed	determine 	the	physical and chemical 
properties of elements 
and their compounds.
Numerous forms of Periodic Table have 
been devised from time to time. Some 
forms emphasise chemical reactions and valence, whereas others stress the electronic configuration
	of	elements. 	A	modern	version,	
the so-called 
“long form” of the Periodic 
table	of	the	elements	(Fig.	3.2),	is	the	most	
convenient and widely used. 
The horizontal 
rows (which Mendeleev called series) are called periods and the vertical columns, 
groups. Elements having similar outer electronic configurations in their atoms are arranged in vertical columns, referred to as groups or families. According to the 
recommendation of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the groups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing the older notation of groups IA …  VIIA, VIII, IB …  VIIB and 0.
There are altogether seven periods. The 
period number corresponds to the highest 
principal quantum number (n ) of the elements 
in
	the	per
iod.	The	firs

s. The subsequent periods consists of 
8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The seventh period is incomplete and like the sixth period would have a theoretical maximum (on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32 elements. In this form of the Periodic Table, 14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods (lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are placed in separate panels at the bottom

those of all the transuranium elements from 94 to 102 led to reconfiguration of the periodic table placing the actinoids below 
the lanthanoids. In 1951, Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work. Element 106 has been named Seaborgium (Sg) in his honour.

a few atoms of them are obtained. Their 
synthesis and characterisation, therefore, require highly sophisticated costly equipment and laboratory. Such work is carried out with competitive spirit only in some laboratories in the world. Scientists, before collecting the reliable data on the new element, at times get
	tempted	to	claim	for	its	discovery. 	For	
example, 
both American and Soviet scientists 
claimed credit for discovering element 104. 
The Americans named it Rutherfordium whereas Soviets named it Kurchatovium. To avoid such problems, the IUPAC has made recommendation that until a new element’s discovery
	is	proved,	and	its	name	is	officially	
recognised, a systematic nomenclature be derived 
directly from the atomic number of 
the element using the numerical roots for 0 and numbers 1-9. These are shown in  
Table 3.4. The roots are put together in order of digits which make up the atomic number and 
“ium” is added at the end. The IUPAC names for elements with Z above 100 are shown in

In the preceding unit we have learnt that an 
electron in an atom is characterised by a set of 
four quantum numbers, and the principal 
quantum number ( n	)	defines	the	main	energy	
level known as 
shell. We have also studied 
about	the	filling	of	electrons 	into	different	
subshells, also referred to as orbitals
 (s, p, 
d, f) in an atom. The distribution of electrons 
into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic 
configuration. An element’s location in the Periodic
	Table	reflects	the	quantum	numbers	
of	the	last	orbital	filled.	In	this	section	we	
will observe a direct connection between the electronic
	configurations 	of	the	elements	and	
the long form of the Periodic Table.
(a)  Electronic Configurations in Periods
The period indicates the value of n
 for the 
outermost or valence shell. In other words, 
successive period in the Periodic Table is associated
	with	the	filling	of	the	next	higher	
princip
al energy level (n  = 1, n  = 2, etc.). It can be readily seen that the number of elements 
in each period is twice the number of atomic orbitals available in the energy level that is being
	filled.	The	first	period	(n = 1) starts w
ith 
the	fillin
g	of	the	lowest	level	(1s) an
d therefore 
has two elements — hydrogen (ls1) and helium 
(ls2)	when	the	first	shell	(K ) is completed. The 
second period (n  = 2) starts with lithium and the 
third electron enters the 2s orbital. The next element, beryllium has four electrons and has the
	electronic 	configuration 	1s22s2. Starting 
from the next element boron, the 2p orbitals are
	filled	with	electrons	when	the	L 
shell is 
completed at neon (2s22p6). Thus there are  
8 elements in the second period. The third period (n  = 3) begins at sodium, and the added 
electron enters a 3s
	orbital.	Successive 	filling	
of 3
s and 3p orbitals gives rise to the third 
period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The fourth period (n = 4) starts at potassium, and the
	added	electrons	fill	up	the	4s
 orbital. Now 
you may note that before the 4p 	orbital	is	fill
ed,	
filling	up	of	3d
 orbitals becomes energetically 
favourable and we come across the so called 3d transition series of elements. This starts from scandium (Z = 21) which has the electronic 
configuration
	3d14s2. The 3d	orbitals	are	filled	
at zinc 
(Z=30)	with	electronic 	configuration 	 
3d104s2. The fourth period ends at krypton 
with	the	filling	up	of	the	4p orbitals. Altogether
 
we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The fifth
	period	(n
 = 5) beginning with rubidium 
is similar to the fourth period and contains the 4d transition series starting at yttrium  
(Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the filling
	up	of	the	5p
 orbitals. The sixth period  
(n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive electrons enter 6s, 4f, 5d and 6p orbitals, in the
	order	—	filling	up	of	the	4f
 orbitals begins 
with cerium (Z = 58) and ends at lutetium  
(Z = 71) to give the 4f-inner transition series which is called the lanthanoid series. The 
seventh period (n = 7) is similar to the sixth period
	with	the	successive 	filling	up	of	the	
7s
, 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals and includes most 
of the man-made radioactive elements. This period will end at the element with atomic number 118 which would belong to the noble 
gas family.

actinium (Z  = 89) gives the 5f -inner transition 
series known as the actinoid series. The 4f- 
and 5f-inner transition series of elements are placed separately in the Periodic Table to maintain its structure and to preserve the principle
	of	classification 	by	keeping	elements	
with similar properties in a single column.
Problem 3.2
How would you justify the presence 
of 18 elements in the 5th period of the 
Periodic Table?
solution
When n
 = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order 
in which the energy of the available orbitals 4d, 5s and 5p increases is 5s < 4d < 5p. The total number of orbitals 
available are 9. The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated is
 18; and t
herefore  18 elem
ents are 
there in the 5th period.
(b) Groupwise Electronic Configurations
Elements in the same vertical column or 
group have similar valence shell electronic configurations,
	the	same	number	of	electrons	
in the outer orbitals, and similar 
properties. 
For	example,	the	Group	1	elements	(alkali	
metals) all 
have ns1 valence shell electronic 
configuration 	as	shown	below.a theoretical foundation for the periodic
 
classification. 	The	elements	in	a	vertical	column	
of 
the Periodic Table constitute a group or 
family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour. 
This similarity arises because these elements have the same number and same distribution of electrons in their outermost orbitals. We can classify the elements into four blocks viz.,   s-block, p-block, d-block and f -block  
depending on the type of atomic orbitals that are
	being	fill
ed	wi
th	el
ectrons.	This	is	il
lustrated	
in	Fig.	3.3.	We	notice	two	exceptions 	to	this	
categorisati
on. Strictly, helium belongs to the  
s-block but its positioning in the p-block 
along with other group 18 elements is justified
	because	it	has	a	com
pletely	fill
ed	
valence shell (1s2) and as a result, exhibits 
properties characteristic of other noble gases. The other exception is hydrogen. It has only one s-electron and hence can be placed in  
group 1 (alkali metals). It can also gain an electron to achieve a noble gas arrangement and hence it can behave similar to a group 17 (halogen family) elements. Because it is a special case, we shall place hydrogen separately at the top of the
	Periodic	Table	as	shown	in	Fig.	3.2	and	 
Fig.	3.3.	We	will	briefly	discuss	the	salient	
fe
atures of the four types of elements marked in 
the Periodic Table. More about these elements 
Thus it can be seen that the properties of 
an element have periodic dependence upon 
its atomic number and not on relative atomic 
mass.

reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies. 
They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to form 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+ ion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The metallic character and the reactivity increase as we go down the group. Because of high reactivity they are never found pure in nature. The compounds of the s-block elements, with 
the exception of those of lithium and beryllium are predominantly ionic.
3.6.2
 The p-Block Elements
The
 p-Block Elements comprise those 
belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these 
together with the s-Block Elements are called the Representative Elements or Main Group Elements. The outermost electronic configuration varies from ns
2np1 to ns2np6 
in each period. At the end of each period is a noble gas element with a closed valence shell ns
2np6 configuration. All the orbitals 
in the valence shell of the noble gases are completely filled by electrons and it is very difficult to alter this stable arrangement by the addition or removal of electrons. The noble gases thus exhibit very low chemical reactivity. Preceding the noble gas family are two chemically important groups of non-metals. They are the halogens (Group 17) and the chalcogens (Group 16). These two groups 
of elements have highly negative electron gain enthalpies and readily add one or two electrons respectively to attain the stable noble gas configuration. The non-metallic character increases as we move from left to right across a period and metallic character increases as we go down the group.
3.6.3
 The d-Block Elements (Transition  
 Elements)
These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in 
the centre of the Periodic Table. These are
 
characterised by the filling of inner d orbitals 
by electrons and are therefore referred to as  
d-Block Elements. These elements have the general outer electronic configuration  
(n-1)d
1-10ns0-2 except for Pd where its electronic 
configuration is 4d105s0.. They are all metals. 
They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and 
oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and 
Hg which have the electronic configuration, (n-1) d
10ns2 do not show most of the properties 
of transition elements. In a way, transition metals form a bridge between the chemically active metals of s-block elements and the less active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and thus take their familiar name “Transition Elements”.
3.6.4
 The f-Block Elements  
 (Inner-Transition Elements)
The two rows of elements at the bottom of 
the Periodic Table, called the 
Lanthanoids,  
Ce(Z = 58) – Lu( Z = 71) and Actinoids,  
Th(Z = 90) – Lr (Z = 103) are characterised by 
the outer electronic configuration (n -2)f1-14 
(n-1)d0–1ns2. The last electron added to each 
element is filled in f- orbital. These two series 
of elements are hence called the 
Inner-
Transition Elements ( f-Block Elements). 
They are all metals. Within each series, the properties of the elements are quite similar. The chemistry of the early actinoids is more complicated than the corresponding lanthanoids, due to the large number of oxidation states possible for these actinoid elements. Actinoid elements are radioactive. Many of the actinoid elements have been made only in nanogram quantities or even less by nuclear reactions and their chemistry is not fully studied. The elements after uranium are 
called Transuranium Elements.
Problem 3.3
The elements  Z  = 117 and 120 have not yet 
been discovered. In which family/group  
would you place these elements and 
also give the electronic configuration in each case.
Solution
We see from Fig. 3.2, that element 
with Z = 117, would belong to the 
halogen family (Group 17) and the electronic configuration would be [Rn] 5f
146d107s27p5. The element with Z = 120, 
will be placed in Group 2 (alkaline earth metals), and will have the electronic configuration [Uuo]8s

3.6.5  metals, non-metals and metalloids
In	additi
on	to	displaying 	the	classification 	
of elements into s-
, p-, d-, and f-blocks, 
Fig.	3.3	shows	another	broad	classification 	
of elements based on their properties. The 
elements can be divided into meta
ls and 
non-metal
s. Metals comprise more than 
78% of all known elements and appear on the left side of the Periodic 
table
. Metals are 
usually solids at room temperature [mercury is an exception; gallium and caesium also have very low melting points (303K and 302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high melting and boiling points. They are good conductors of heat and electricity. They are malleable
	(can	be	flatt
ened	int
o	thi
n	sheets	by	
hammering) and ductile 
(can be drawn into 
wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at the top right hand side of the Periodic 
table
. 
In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of elements change from metallic on the left to non-metallic on the right. Non-metals are usually solids or gases at room temperature with low melting and boiling points (boron and carbon are exceptions). They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. Most non-metallic solids are brittle and are neither malleable nor ductile. The elements become more metallic as we go down a group; the non-metallic character increases as one goes from left to right across the Periodic 
table
. 
The change from metallic to non-metallic character is not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag
	line	in	Fig.	3.3.	The	elements	(e.g.,	
silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium) bordering this line and running diagonally across the 
Periodic table
 show 
properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals. These elements are called 
semi-metals
 or metalloids
.
Problem 3.4
Considering the atomic number and 
position in the periodic table, arrange the following elements in the increasing order
	of	metallic	character 	:	Si,	Be,	Mg,	
Na, P.solution
Metallic 
character increases down a 
group and decreases along a period as we move from left to right. Hence the order of increasing metallic character is:
	P	<	Si	<	Be	<	Mg	<	Na.
3.7 PEriodi C trEnds in 
ProPErtiEs 
of ElEmEnts
There are many observable patterns 
in the 
physical and chemical properties of elements 
as we descend in a group or move across a period
	in	the	Periodic	Table.	For	example,	
within a period, chemical reactivity 
tends to 
be high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements towards the middle of the table, and increases to a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals. Likewise within a group of representative metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases on moving down the group, whereas within a group of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity decreases down the group. But why do the properties of elements follow these trends? And how can we explain periodicity? To answer these questions, we must look into the theories of atomic structure and properties of the atom. In this section we shall discuss the periodic trends in certain physical and chemical properties and try to explain them in terms of number of electrons and energy levels.
3.7.1
 
trends in Physical Properties
There are numerous physical properties of
 
elements such as melting and boiling points, 
heats of fusion and vaporization, energy of atomization, etc. which show periodic variations. However, we shall discuss the periodic trends with respect to atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity.
(a) Atomic Radius
You
	can	very	well	imagine	that	finding	the	
size of an atom is a lot more complicated than 
measuring the radius of 
a ball. Do you know 
why?	Fir

chemistry
small. Secondly, since the electron cloud 
surrounding the atom does not have a sharp boundary, the determination of the atomic size cannot be precise. In other words, there 
is no practical way by which the size of an individual atom can be measured. However, an estimate of the atomic size can be made by knowing the distance between the atoms in the combined state. One practical approach to estimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic element is to measure the distance between two atoms when they are bound together by a single bond in a covalent molecule and from this value, the “ Covalent 
radius
” of the 
element	can	be	calculated. 	For	example,	the	
bond distance in 
the chlorine molecule (Cl2) 
is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is taken
	as	the	atomic	radius	of	chlorine.	For	
metals,	we	define	the	term	“metall
ic radius”
 
which is taken as half the internuclear distance separating the metal cores in the metallic
	crystal.	For	example,	the	distance	
between two adjacent copper atoms in solid copper is 256 pm; 
hence the metallic radius 
of	copper	is	assigned	a	value	of	128	pm.	For	
si
mplicity, in this book, we use the term 
atomic radius
 to refer to both covalent or 
metallic radius depending on whether the element is a non-metal or a metal. Atomic radii can be measured by X -ray or other 
spectroscopic methods. The atomic radii of a few elements are listed 
in Table 3.6. Two trends are obvious. We can 
explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge and energy level. The atomic size generally decreases across a period as illustrated in  
Fig.
	3.4(a)	for	the	elements	of	the	second	
period. It is because within the period the outer electrons are in the same valence shell a
nd the effective nuclear charge increases 
as the atomic number increases resulting in the increased attraction of electrons to the nucleus. Within a family or vertical column of the periodic table , the atomic radius 
increases regularly with atomic number as illustrated
	in	Fig.	3.4(b).	For	alkali	metals	
and halogens, as we descend the groups, the principal quantum 
number (n) increases 
and the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. This happens because the inner energy
	levels	are	filled	with	electrons, 	which	
serve to 
shield the outer electrons from the 
pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of the
	atom	increases 	as	reflected	in	the	atomic	
radii.
Note that 
the atomic radii of noble gases 
are not considered here. Being monoatomic, their (non-bonded radii) values are very large. In fact radii of noble gases should be compared not with the covalent radii but with the van der Waals radii of other elements.

(b) Ionic Radius
The removal of an electron from an atom 
results in the formation of a cation, whereas gain of an electron leads to an anion. The ionic radii can be estimated by measuring the distances between cations and anions in ionic crystals. In general, the ionic radii of elements exhibit the same trend as the atomic radii. A cation is smaller than its parent atom because it has fewer electrons while its nuclear charge remains the same. The size of an anion will be larger than that of the parent atom because the addition of one or more electrons would result in increased repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in
	effective	nuclear	charge.	For	example,	the	
ionic	radius	of	fluoride	ion	(F–) is 136 pm 
whereas	the	atomic	radius	of	fluorine	is	only	
64 pm. On the other hand, the atomic radius of sodium is 186 pm compared to the ionic radius of 95 pm for Na
+.
When	we	find	some	atoms	and	ions	which	
contain the same number of electrons, we call them isoelectronic species*
.	For	example,	 
O2–,	F–, Na+ and Mg2+ have the same number 
of electrons (10). Their radii would be different because of their different nuclear charges. The Fig. 3.4 (a)   Variation of atomic radius with atomic 
number across the second periodFig. 3.4 (b)  Variation of atomic radius with atomic number for alkali metals and halogens
cation with the greater positive charge will have a smaller radius because of the greater 
attraction of the electrons to the nucleus. Anion with the greater negative charge will have the larger radius. In this case, the net repulsion of the electrons will outweigh the nuclear charge and the ion will expand in size.
Problem 3.5
Which of the following species will have 
the largest and the smallest size?Mg, Mg
2+, Al, Al3+.
solution
Atomic 
radii decrease across a period. 
Cations are smaller than their parent atoms. Among isoelectronic species, the one with the larger positive nuclear charge will have a smaller radius.
Hence the largest species is Mg; the 
smallest one is Al
3+.
(c) Ionization Enthalpy
A quantitative measure of the tendency of 
an element to lose electron is given by its 
ioni
zation Enthalpy. It represents the 
energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom (X) in its ground state. 
*  Two or more species with same number of atoms, same number of valence electrons and same structure, regardless of the 
nature of elements involved.

chemistry
In	other	words,	the	first	ionization enthalpy 
for an element X is the enthalpy change
  
(∆i H) for the reaction depicted in equation 3.1.
X(g) → X+(g) + e–           (3.1)
The ionization enthalpy is expressed in 
units of kJ mol–1.	We	can	define	the	second	
ionization enthalpy 
as the energy required 
to remove the second most loosely bound 
electron; it is the energy required to carry out the reaction shown in equation 3.2.X
+(g) → X2+(g) + e–           (3.2)
Energy is always required to remove 
electrons from an atom and hence ionization enthalpies are always positive. The second ionization enthalpy will be higher than the first
	ionization 	enthalpy	because	it	is	more	
difficult	to	remove	an	electron	from	a	positively	
charged ion than from a neutral atom. 
In the 
same way the third ionization enthalpy will be higher than the second and so on. The term “ionization
	entha
lpy”,	if	not	qualifi
ed,	is	taken	
as	the	first	ionization 	enthalpy.

the other hand, minima occur at the alkali metals and their low ionization enthalpies

as we go across a period and decreases as 
we descend in a group. These trends

properties. To understand these trends, we have

valence electron in an atom will be less than 
the actual charge on the nucleus because of “shielding” or “screening” of the valence electron from the nucleus by the intervening core
	electrons. 	For	example,	the	2s
 electron 
in lithium is shielded from the nucleus by the inner core of 1s electrons. As a result, the valence electron experiences a net positive charge which is  less than the actual charge of +3. In general, shielding is effective when the orbitals in the inner shells are completely filled.
	This	situation	occurs	in	the	case	of	
alkali metals which have single outermost ns
-electron preceded by a noble gas electronic 
configuration.
When	we	move	from	lithium	to	fluorine	
across the second period, successive electrons 
are added to orbitals in the same principal qua
ntum level and the shielding of the nuclear 
charge by the inner core of electrons does not increase very much to compensate for the increased attraction of the electron to the nucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing nuclear charge outweighs the shielding. Consequently, the outermost electrons are held more and more tightly and the ionization enthalpy increases across a period. As we go down a group, the outermost electron being increasingly farther from the nucleus, there is an increased shielding of the nuclear charge by the electrons in the inner levels. In this case, increase in shielding outweighs the increasing nuclear charge and the removal of the outermost electron requires less energy down a group.
From
	Fig.	3.6(a),	you	will	also	notice	that	
the	first	ionization 	enthalpy	of	boron	(Z
 = 5) 
is slightly less than that of beryllium (Z = 4) 
even though the former has a greater nuclear charge. When we consider the same principal quantum level, an s -electron is attracted to the 
nucleus more than a p-electron. In beryllium, 
the electron removed during the ionization is an s-electron whereas the electron removed 
during ionization of boron is a p -electron. The 
penetration of a 2s-electron to the nucleus is more than that of a 2p-electron; hence the 2p electron of boron is more shielded from the nucleus by the inner core of electrons than the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is 
easier to remove the 2p-electron from boron compared to the removal of a 2s- electron from 
beryllium.
	Thus,	boron	has	a	smaller	first	
ionization enthalpy than beryllium. 
Another 
“anomaly” is the smaller first ionization enthalpy of oxygen compared to nitrogen. This arises because in the nitrogen atom, three 2p-electrons reside in different atomic orbitals 
(Hund’s rule) whereas in the oxygen atom, two of the four 2p-electrons must occupy the same 2p-orbital resulting in an increased electron-electron repulsion. Consequently, it is easier to remove the fourth 2p-electron from oxygen than it is, to remove one of the three 2p-electrons from nitrogen.
Problem 3.6  
The	first	ionization 	enthalpy	(∆i H ) values 
of the third period elements, Na, Mg and 
Si are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ  
mol–1.	Predict	whether	the	first	∆i H value 
for Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ  
mol–1 ? Justify your answer.
solution 
It will be more close to 575 kJ mol–1. 
The value for Al should be lower than that of Mg because of effective shielding of 3p  electrons from the nucleus by  
3s-electrons.
(d) Electron Gain Enthalpy 
When an electron is added to a neutral 
gaseous atom (X) to convert it into a negative ion, the enthalpy change accompanying the process is defined as the Electron Gain Enthalpy ( ∆
egH). Electron gain enthalpy 
provides a measure of the ease with which an atom adds an electron to form anion as represented by equation 3.3.
X(g) + e
–  →  X–(g)            (3.3)
Depending on the element, the process 
of adding an electron to the atom can be
 
either	endothermic 	or	exothermic. 	For	many	
elements energy is released when an electron 
is added to the atom and the electron gain enthalpy
	is	negative. 	For	example, 	group	
17 el
ements (the halogens) have very high

chemistry
negative electron gain enthalpies because 
they can attain stable noble gas electronic configurations
	by	picking	up	an	electron.	
On the other hand, noble gases have large 
positiv
e electron gain enthalpies because the 
electron has to enter the next higher principal 
quantum level leading to a very unstable electronic
	configuration. 	It	may	be	noted	that	
electron gain enthalpies have large 
negative 
values toward the upper right of the periodic table preceding the noble gases.
The variation in electron gain enthalpies of 
elements is less systematic than for ionization enthalpies. As a general rule, electron gain enthalpy becomes more negative with increase in the atomic number across a period. The effective nuclear charge increases from left to right across a period and consequently it will be easier to add an electron to a smaller atom since the added electron on an average would be closer to the positively charged nucleus. We should also expect electron gain enthalpy to become less negative as we go down a group because the size of the atom increases and the added electron would be farther from the nucleus. This is generally the case (Table 3.7). However, electron gain enthalpy of O or F
	is	less	negative	than	that	of	the	succeeding 	
element. This 
is because when an electron is 
added	to	O	or	F,	the	added	electron	goes	to	
the smaller n = 2 quantu
m level and suffers 
significant 	repulsion 	from	the	other	electrons	
present	in	this	level.	For	the	n = 3 quantum 
level (S or Cl), 
the added electron occupies 
a larger region of space and the electron-
electron repulsion is much less.Problem 3.7
Which of the following will have the most 
negative electron gain enthalpy and which the least negative?P,
	S,	Cl,	F.
Explain your answer.
solution
Electron gain enthalpy generally
 
becomes more negative across a period as we move from left to right. Within a group, electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative down a group. However, adding an electron to the 2p-orbital leads to greater repulsion 
than adding an electron to the larger  
3p-orbital. Hence the element with 
most negative electron gain enthalpy is chlorine; the one with the least negative electron gain enthalpy is phosphorus.
(e) Electronegativity
A qualitative measure of the ability of an atom 
in a chemical compound to attract shared electrons to itself is called electronegativity. 
Unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy, it is not a measureable quantity. However, a number of numerical scales of electronegativity of elements viz., Pauling scale, Mulliken-Jaffe scale, Allred-Rochow scale have been developed. The one which is the most widely used is the Pauling scale. Linus Pauling, an American scientist, in 1922 assigned
	arbitrarily 	a	value	of	4.0	to	fluorine,	
the element considered to have the greatest 
* In many books, the negative of the enthalpy change for the process depicted in equation 3.3 is defined as the ELECTRON 
AFFINITY (Ae ) of the atom under consideration. If energy is released when an electron is added to an atom, the electron 
affinity is taken as positive, contrary to thermodynamic convention. If energy has to be supplied to add an electron to an atom, then the electron affinity of the atom is assigned a negative sign. However, electron affinity is defined as absolute zero and, therefore at any other temperature (T) heat capacities of the reactants and the products have to be taken into account in ∆

ability to attract electrons. Approximate 
values for the electronegativity of a few elements are given in Table 3.8(a)
The electronegativity of any given element 
is not constant; it varies depending on the element to which it is bound. Though it is not a measurable quantity, it does provide a means of predicting the nature of force that holds a pair of atoms together – a relationship that you will explore later.
Electronegativity generally 
increases across a period from left to right (say from lithium to fluorine)
	and	decrease	down	a	group	
(say	from	fluorine	to	astati
ne)	
in the periodic table. How can these trends be explained?
 
Can the electronegativity be related to atomic radii, which tend to decrease across each period from left to right, but increase down each group ? The attraction between the outer (or valence) electrons and the nucleus increases as the atomic radius decreases in a period. The electronegativity also increases. On the same account electronegativity values decrease with the increase in atomic radii down a group. The trend is similar to that of ionization enthalpy.
Knowing the relationship between 
electronegativity and atomic radius, can you now visualise the relationship between electronegativity and non-metallic properties? Non-metallic  elements have strong tendency

to gain electrons. Therefore, electronegativity is 
directly related to that non-metallic properties of elements. It can be further extended to say that the electronegativity is inversely related to the metallic properties of elements. Thus, the increase in electronegativities across a period is accompanied by an increase in non-metallic properties (or decrease in metallic properties) of elements. Similarly, the decrease in electronegativity down a group is accompanied by a decrease in non-metallic properties (or increase in metallic properties) of elements.
All these periodic trends are summarised 
in
	Figure	3.7.
3.7.2  Periodic trends in Chemical  
 
 Properties
Most 
of the trends in chemical properties of 
elements, such as diagonal relationships, inert pair effect, effects of lanthanoid contraction etc. will be dealt with along the discussion of each group in later units. In this section we shall study the periodicity of the valence state shown by elements and the anomalous properties of the second period elements (from lithium
	to	fluorine).
(a) Periodicity of Valence 
or Oxidation  
     States
The valence is the most characteristic property 
of the elements and can be understood in terms
	of	their	electronic 	configurations. 	
	The	
valence of 
representative elements is usually 
(though not necessarily) equal to the number of electrons in the outermost orbitals and/or equal to eight minus the number of outermost electrons as shown below. 
Nowadays the term oxidation state is 
frequently used for valence. Consider the two
	oxygen	containing 	compounds: 	OF2 and 
Na2O. The order of electronegativity of the 
three elements involved in these compounds is
	F	>	O	>	Na.	Each	of	the	atoms	of	fluorine,	with	outer	electronic 	configuration 	2s22p5, 
shares	one	electron	with	oxygen	in	the	OF2 
molecule. Being highest electronegative element, fluorine is given oxidation state –1.
	Since	there	are	two	fluorine	atoms	in	
this molecule, 
oxygen with outer electronic 
configuration 	2s22p4 shares two electrons 
with fluorine atoms and thereby exhibits oxidation state +2. In Na
2O, oxygen being 
more electronegative accepts two electrons, one from each of the two sodium atoms and, thus, shows oxidation state –2. On the other hand
	sodium	with	electronic 	configuration 	
3s1 loses one electron to oxygen and is given 
oxidation state +1. Thus, the oxidation state of an element in a particular compound can be
	defined	as	the	charge	acquired	by	its	atom	
on the 
basis of electronegative consideration 
from other atoms in the molecule.
Problem 3.8
Using the Periodic Table, predict the 
formulas of compounds which might be formed by the following pairs of elements; (a) silicon and bromine  
(b) aluminium and sulphur.
solution
(a) Silicon is 
group 14 element with 
a valence of 4; bromine belongs to the halogen family with a valence of 1. Hence the formula of the compound formed would be SiBr
4.
(b) Aluminium belongs to group 13 with a valence of 3; sulphur 
belongs to 
group 16 elements with 
a valence of 2. Hence, the formula of the compound formed would be Al
2S3.

72the second element of the following group 
i.e., magnesium and aluminium, respectively. 
This sort of similarity is commonly referred to as diagonal relationship in the periodic properties. 
What are the reasons for the different 
chemical
	behaviour 	of	the	first	member	of	
a group of elements in the 
s- and p-blocks 
compared to that of the subsequent members in the same group? The anomalous behaviour is attributed to their small size, large charge/radius ratio and high electronegativity of the elements.
	
	In	addition,	the	first	member	of	
group has only four valence orbitals (2s
 and 
2p) available for bonding, whereas the second 
member of the groups have nine valence orbitals (3s , 3p, 3d). As a consequence of 
this, the maximum covalency of the first 
member of each group is 4 (e.g., boron 
can only form 
BF4/unif05b/unif05d/unif02d, whereas the other 
members of the groups can expand their 
valence shell to accommodate more than four pairs of electrons e.g., aluminium 
AlF63/unif05b/unif05d/unif02d forms).	Furthermore, 	the	first	
member of
 p-block elements displays 
greater ability to form pπ – pπ  multiple 
bonds to itself (e.g., C = C, C ≡ C,   
N = N, N ≡	Ν) and to 
other second period 
elements (e.g., C =  O, C = N, C ≡  N,  
N = O) compared to subsequent members 
of the same group.

3.7.3  Periodic trends
 and Chemical  
 r eactivity
We 
have observed the periodic trends in 
certain fundamental properties such as 
atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and valence. We know by now that the periodicity is related to electronic
	configuration. 	That	is,	all	chemical	
and phy
sical properties are a manifestation of 
the	electronic 	configuration 	of	elements. 	We	
shall now try to explore relationships between these fundamental properties of elements with
 
their chemical reactivity.
The atomic and ionic radii, as we know, 
generally decrease in a period from left to right. As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies generally increase (with some exceptions as outlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain enthalpies become more negative across a period. In other words, the ionization enthalpy of the extreme left element in a period is the least and the electron gain enthalpy of the element on the extreme right is the highest negative
	(not
e	:	noble	gases	having	complet
ely	
filled shells have rather positive 
electron 
gain enthalpy values). This results into high chemical reactivity at the two extremes and the lowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum chemical reactivity at the extreme left (among alkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an electron leading to the formation of a cation and at the extreme right (among halogens) shown by the gain of an electron forming an anion. This property can be related with the reducing and oxidizing behaviour of the elements which you will learn later. However, here it can be directly related to the metallic 
and non-metallic character of elements. Thus, the metallic character of an element, which is highest at the extremely left decreases and the non-metallic character increases while moving from left to right across the period. The chemical reactivity of an element can be best shown by its reactions with oxygen and halogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction of the elements with oxygen only. Elements on two extremes of a period easily combine with oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide formed by the element on extreme left is the most basic (e.g., Na
2O), whereas that formed 
by the element on extreme right is the most acidic (e.g., Cl
2O7). Oxides of elements in the 
centre are amphoteric (e.g., Al2O3, As2O3) or 
neutral (e.g., CO, NO, N2O). Amphoteric oxides 
behave as acidic with bases and as basic with acids, whereas neutral oxides have no acidic or basic properties.
Problem 3.10
Show by a chemical reaction with water 
that Na2O is a basic oxide and Cl2O7 is 
an acidic oxide.
solution
Na2O with water forms a strong base 
whereas Cl2O7 forms strong acid.
Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH
Cl2O7 + H2O → 2HClO4
Their basic or acidic nature can be 
qualitatively tested with litmus paper.
Among transition metals (3d  series), the 
change in atomic radii is much smaller as 
compared to those of representative elements across the period. The change in atomic radii is still smaller among inner-transition metals  
(4f series). The ionization enthalpies are 
intermediate between those of s- and p-blocks. As a consequence, they are less electropositive than group 1 and 2 metals.

In a group, the increase in atomic and 
ionic radii with increase in atomic number 
generally results in a gradual decrease in ionization enthalpies and a regular decrease (with exception in some third period elements as shown in section 3.7.1(d)) in electron 
gain enthalpies in the case of main group 
elements. Thus, the metallic character increases down the group and non-metallic character decreases. This trend can be related with their reducing and oxidizing property which you will learn later. In the case of transition elements, however, a reverse trend is observed. This can be explained in terms of atomic size and ionization enthalpy.
sUmmary
In this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic law  and the Periodic table . 
Mendeleev’s Periodic table
 was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic table
 arranges 
the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and 
eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar valence shell
	electronic 	configuration 	and,	therefore, 	exhibit	similar	chemical	properties. 	
However, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons from
	left	to	right,	and,	therefore, 	have	different	valencies. 	Four	types	of	elements	can	be	
recognized 	in	the	periodic	table	on	the	basis	of	their	electronic 	configurations. 	These	are	
s-block, p-block, d-block and 
f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s  orbital 
occupies a unique position in the periodic table. metals
 comprise more than seventy eight 
per cent of the known elements. non-metals
, which are located at the top of the periodic 
table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character 
increases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right in a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their atomic numbers.
 Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain 
enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from 
left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies 
generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period is because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.
