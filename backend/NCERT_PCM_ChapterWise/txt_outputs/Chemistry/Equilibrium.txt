Chemical equilibria are important in numerous biological 
and environmental processes. For example, equilibria involving O
2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play 
a crucial role in the transport and delivery of O2 from 
our lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO molecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.
When a liquid evaporates in a closed container, 
molecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape the liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of liquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid surface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise to a constant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium  in 
which the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the number returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that the system has reached equilibrium state at this stage. However, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of activity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour. Thus, at equilibrium , the rate of evaporation is equal to the 
rate of condensation. It may be represented by
H
2O (l)   H2O (vap)
The double half arrows indicate that the processes 
in both the directions are going on simultaneously. The mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an equilibrium mixture.
Equilibrium can be established for both physical 
processes and chemical reactions. The reaction may be fast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and the nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed vessel at a particular temperature react to give products, the concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing, while those of products keep on increasing for some time after which there is no change in the concentrations 
of either of the reactants or products. This stage of the system is the dynamic equilibrium and the rates of the 
forward and reverse reactions become equal. It is due to After studying this unit you will be

EQUILIBRIUM
this dynamic equilibrium stage that there is 
no change in the concentrations of various species in the reaction mixture. Based on the extent to which the reactions proceed to reach the state of chemical equilibrium,  these may 
be classified in three groups.
(i)
 The reactions that proceed nearly 
to compl
etion and only negligible 
concentrations of the reactants are left. In some cases, it may not be even possible to detect these experimentally.
(ii)
 The reactions in which only small
 
amounts of products are formed and most of the reactants remain unchanged at equilibrium stage.
(iii)
 The reactions in which the concentrations of the
 reactants and products are 
comparable, when the system is in equilibrium.
The extent of a reaction in equilibrium 
varies with the experimental conditions such 
as concentrations of reactants, temperature, etc. Optimisation of the operational conditions is very important in industry and laboratory so that equilibrium is favorable in the direction of the desired product. Some important aspects of equilibrium involving physical and chemical processes are dealt in this unit along with the equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solutions which is called as ionic equilibrium.

The characteristics of system 
at equilibrium 
are better understood if we examine some 
physical processes. The most familiar examples are phase transformation processes , e.g.,
 solid        liquid 
 liquid        gas
 solid         gas
6.1.1  Solid- liquid Equilibrium
Ice and water kept in a perfectly insulated thermos flask 
(no exchange of heat between its 
contents and the surroundings) at 273K and 
the atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium state and the system shows interesting characteristic features. We observe that the 
mass of ice and water do not change with time and the temperature remains constant. However, the equilibrium is not static. The intense activity can be noticed at the boundary between ice and water. Molecules from the liquid water collide against ice and adhere to it and some molecules of ice escape into liquid phase. There is no change of mass of ice and water, as the rates of transfer of molecules from ice into water and of reverse transfer from water into ice are equal at atmospheric pressure and 273 K. 
It is obvious that ice and water are in 
equilibrium only at particular temperature 
and pressure. For any pure substance at 
atmospheric pressure, the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases are at equilibrium is called the normal melting point or normal freezing point of the substance .  The 
system here is in dynamic equilibrium and we can infer the following:(i)
 Both the opposing processes occur simultaneously.
(ii)
 Both the processes occur at the same rate 
so that the amount of ice and water 
remains constant.
6.1.2  liquid-Vapour Equilibrium
This equilibrium can be better understood if 
we consider the example of a transparent box carrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer).
 
Drying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride (or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for a few hours in the box. After removing the drying agent by tilting the box on one side, a watch glass (or petri dish) containing water is quickly placed inside the box. It will be observed that the mercury level in the right limb of the manometer slowly increases and finally attains a constant value, that is, the pressure inside the box increases and reaches a constant value. Also the volume of water in the watch glass decreases (Fig. 6.1). Initially there was no water vapour (or very less) inside the box. As water evaporated the pressure in the box increased due to addition of water 
molecules into the gaseous phase inside the box. The rate of evaporation is constant.

chemistry
However, the rate of increase in pressure 
decreases with time due to condensation of vapour into water. Finally it leads to an equilibrium condition when there is no net evaporation. This implies that the number of water molecules from the gaseous state into the liquid state also increases till the equilibrium is attained i.e.,
rate of evaporation= rate of condensation
H
2O(l)          H2O (vap)
At equilibrium the pressure exerted by 
the water molecules at a given temperature remains constant and is called the equilibrium vapour pressure of water (or just vapour pressure of water); vapour pressure of water increases with temperature. If the above experiment is repeated with methyl alcohol, acetone and ether, it is observed that different liquids have different equilibrium vapour pressures at the same temperature, and the liquid which has a higher vapour pressure is more volatile and has a lower boiling point. 
If we expose three watch glasses containing 
separately 1mL each of acetone, ethyl alcohol, and water to atmosphere and repeat the experiment with different volumes of the liquids in a warmer room, it is observed that in all such cases the liquid eventually disappears and the time taken for complete evaporation depends on (i) the nature of the liquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the temperature. When the watch glass is open to the atmosphere, the rate of evaporation remains constant but the molecules are 
dispersed into large volume of the room. As a consequence the rate of condensation from vapour to liquid state is much less than the 
rate of evaporation. These are open systems and it is not possible to reach equilibrium in an open system.
Water and water vapour are in equilibrium 
position at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar) and at 100°C in a closed vessel. The boiling point of water is 100°C at 1.013 bar pressure. For any pure liquid at one atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar), the temperature at which the liquid and vapours are at equilibrium is called normal boiling point of the liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends on the atmospheric pressure. It depends on the altitude of the place; at high altitude the boiling point decreases. 
6.1.3
 Solid – Vapour Equilibrium
Let us now consider the systems where solids 
sublime 
to vapour phase. If we place solid 
iodine in a closed vessel, after sometime the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour and the intensity of colour increases with time. After certain time the intensity of colour becomes constant and at this stage equilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine sublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine vapour condenses to give solid iodine. The equilibrium can be represented as,
I

equilibrium are,

6.1.4  Equilibrium Involving Dissolution 
of Solid or Gases in Liquids
Solids in liquids
We know f
rom our experience that we can 
dissolve only a limited amount of salt or 
sugar in a given amount of water at room temperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup solution by dissolving sugar at a higher temperature, sugar crystals separate out if we cool the syrup to the room temperature. We call it a saturated solution when no more of solute can be dissolved in it at a given  temperature. The concentration of the solute in a saturated solution depends upon the temperature. In a saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium exits between the solute molecules in the solid state and in the solution:
Sugar (solution) 
 Sugar (solid), and 
the rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of 
crystallisation of sugar.
Equality of the two rates and dynamic 
nature of equilibrium has been confirmed with 
the help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some radioactive sugar into saturated solution of non-radioactive sugar, then after some time radioactivity is observed both in the solution and in the solid sugar. Initially there were no radioactive sugar molecules in the solution but due to dynamic nature of equilibrium, there is exchange between the radioactive and non-radioactive sugar molecules between the two phases. The ratio of the radioactive to non-radioactive molecules in the solution increases till it attains a constant value.
Gases in liquids
When a soda water bottle is opened, some of 
the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes out rapidly. The phenomenon arises due to difference in solubility of carbon dioxide at different pressures. There is equilibrium between the molecules in the gaseous state and the molecules dissolved in the liquid 
under pressure i.e.,
CO
2 (gas)  CO2 (in solution)
This equilibrium is governed by Henry’s 
law, which states that the mass of a gas 
dissolved in a given mass of a solvent at any temperature is proportional to the  pressure of the gas above the solvent.  
This amount decreases with increase of temperature. The soda water bottle is sealed under pressure of gas when its solubility in water is high. As soon as the bottle is opened, some of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas escapes to reach a new equilibrium condition required for the lower pressure, namely its partial pressure in the atmosphere. This is how the soda water in bottle when left open 
to the air for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be generalised that:
(i)
 For solid  liquid equilibrium, there is 
only one temperature (melting point) at  
1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two 
phases can coexist. If there is no exchange of heat with the surroundings, the mass of the two phases remains constant.
(ii)
 For liquid  vapour equilibrium, the 
vapour pressure is constant at a given temperature.
(iii)
 For dissolution of solids in liquids, the solubili
ty is constant at a given 
temperature.
(iv) For dissolution of gases in liquids, the concentration of 
a gas in liquid 
is proportional to the pressure (concentration) of the gas over the liquid. These observations are summarised in Table 6.1

6.1.5  General Characteristics of 
Equilibria Involving Physical Processes
For the physical processes discussed above, following characteristics are common to the system at equilibrium:
(i)
 Equilibrium is possible only in a closed 
system at a given temperature.
(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at the same rate and there is a dynamic but stable condition.
(iii)
 All measurable properties of the system remain constant.
(iv)
 When equilibrium is attained for a physical process, it is characterised by constant value 
of one of its parameters 
at a given temperature. Table 6.1 lists such quantities.
(v)
 The magnitude of such quantities at any stage indicates the extent to which the physical process has proceeded before reaching equilibrium.
6.2
 EQUILIBRIUM IN CHEMICAL PROCESSES – DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM
Analogous to the physical systems chemical reactions also attain a state of equilibrium. These reactions can occur both in forward
 
and backward directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal, the concentrations of the reactants and the products remain constant. This is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This equilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists of a forward reaction in which the reactants give product(s) and reverse reaction in which product(s) gives the original reactants.
For a better comprehension, let us consider 
a general case of a reversible reaction, 
A + B 
 C + D
With passage of time, there is 
accumulation of the products C and D and 
depletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 6.2).  
This leads to a decrease in the rate of forward reaction and an increase in the rate of the reverse reaction,Fig. 6.2  Attainment of chemical equilibrium.
Eventually, the two reactions occur at the 
same rate and the system reaches a state of 
equilibrium. 
Similarly, the reaction can reach the state 
of equilibrium even if we start with only C and D; that is, no A and B being present initially, as the equilibrium can be reached from either direction.
The dynamic nature of chemical 
equilibrium can be demonstrated in the synthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process.  In a series of experiments, Haber started with known amounts of dinitrogen and dihydrogen maintained at high temperature and pressure and at regular intervals determined the amount of ammonia present. He was successful in determining also the concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and dinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after a certain time the composition of the mixture remains the same even though some of the reactants are still present. This constancy in composition indicates that the reaction has reached equilibrium. In order to understand the dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis of ammonia is carried out with exactly the same starting conditions (of partial pressure and temperature) but using D
2 (deuterium) 
in place of H2. The reaction mixtures starting 
either with H2 or D2 reach equilibrium with 
the same composition, except that D2 and 
ND3 are present instead of H2 and NH3.  After

EQUILIBRIUM
Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity
Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can 
be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.
Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 
30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. 
Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, 
close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2
nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner 
from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant.
If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be 
any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning.

2NH3(g)  N2(g) + 3H2(g) 
Similarly let us consider the reaction,  
H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g). If we start with 
equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the 
reaction proceeds in the forward direction 
and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases 
while that of HI increases, until all of these become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We can also start with HI alone and make the reaction to proceed in the reverse direction; the concentration of HI will decrease and concentration of H
2 and I2 will increase until 
they all become constant when equilibrium is reached (Fig. 6.5).  If total number of H and I atoms are same in a given volume, the same equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we start it from pure reactants or pure product.
equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures  
(H
2, N2, NH3 and D2, N2, ND3) are mixed 
together and left for a while.  Later, when 
this mixture is analysed, it is found that the concentration of ammonia is just the same as before. However, when this mixture is analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found that ammonia and all deuterium containing forms of ammonia (NH
3, NH2D, NHD2 and 
ND3) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms  
(H2, HD and D2) are present. Thus one can 
conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in the molecules must result from a continuation of the forward and reverse reactions in the mixture. If the reaction had simply stopped when they reached equilibrium, then there would have been no mixing of isotopes in this way.
Use of isotope (deuterium) in the formation 
of ammonia clearly indicates that chemical 
reactions reach a state of dynamic equilibrium in which the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal and there is no net change in composition.   
Equilibrium can be attained from both 
sides, whether we start reaction by taking, H
2(g) and N2(g) and get NH3(g) or by taking 
NH3(g) and decomposing it into N2(g) and H2(g).

EQUILIBRIUM
composition of an equilibrium mixture? The 
last question in particular is important when choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial chemicals such as H
2, NH3, CaO etc.
To answer these questions, let us consider 
a general reversible reaction:
A + B  C + D
where A and B are the reactants, C and D are the products in the balanced chemical equation. On the basis of experimental studies of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the concentrations in an equilibrium mixture are related by the following equilibrium equation, 
 Kc/unif03d/unif05b/unif05d/unif05b/unif05d
/unif05b/unif05d/unif05b/unif05dCD
AB                (6.1)
  
(6.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant and 
the expression on the right side is called the equilibrium constant expression .
The equilibrium equation is also known as 
the law of mass action because in the early 
days of chemistry, concentration was called “active mass”. In order to appreciate their work better, let us consider reaction between gaseous H
2 and I2 carried out in a sealed vessel 
at 731K.
 H2(g)   +   I2(g)   2HI(g)
 1 mol    1 mol          2 molSix sets of 
experiments with varying initial 
conditions were performed, starting with only 
gaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel 
in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and only HI in other two experiments (5 and 6). Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed taking different concentrations of H
2 and / or 
I2, and with time it was observed that intensity 
of the purple colour remained constant and equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was attained from the opposite direction.
Data obtained from all six sets of 
experiments are given in Table 6.2.
It is evident from the experiments 1, 2, 
3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted = ½ (number of moles of HI formed). Also, experiments 5 and 6 indicate that,
[H
2(g)]eq = [I2(g)]eq
Knowing the above facts, in order 
to establish a relationship between concentrations of the reactants and products, several combinations can be tried. Let us consider the simple expression,
[HI(g)]
eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq
It can be seen from Table 6.3 that if we 
put the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products, the above expression

is far from  constant. However, if we consider 
the expression,
[HI(g)]2
eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq
we find that this expression gives constant value (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six cases. It can be seen that in this expression the power of the concentration for reactants and products are actually the stoichiometric coefficients in the equation for the chemical reaction. Thus, for the reaction H
2(g) + I2(g)   
2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium constant K
c is written as,
Kc  = [HI(g)]eq2 / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq                   (6.2)
Generally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for 
equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration terms. It is taken for granted that the concentrations in the expression for K
c are 
equilibrium values. We, therefore, write,
Kc  = [HI(g)]2 / [H2(g)] [I2(g)]                 (6.3)
The subscript ‘c ’ indicates that Kc is 
expressed in concentrations of mol L–1. 
At a given temperature, the product of 
concentrations of the reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation divided by the product of concentrations of the reactants raised to their individual stoichiometric coefficients has a constant value. 
this is known as 
the Equilibrium law or law of Chemical 
Equilibrium.The equilibrium constant for a general 
reaction,
a A   +  b B  c C  +  d D
is expressed as,
Kc  = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                                       (6.4)
where [A], [B], [C] and [D] are the equilibrium 
concentrations of the reactants and products.
Equilibrium constant for the reaction,
4NH3(g) + 5O2(g)  4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) is written 
as 
Kc  = [NO]4[H2O]6 / [NH3]4 [O2]5  
Molar concentration of different species is 
indicated by enclosing these in square bracket 
and, as mentioned above, it is implied that these are equilibrium concentrations. While writing expression for equilibrium constant, symbol for phases (s, l, g) are generally ignored. 
Let us write equilibrium constant for the 
reaction, H
2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)               (6.5)
as,  Kc = [HI]2 / [H2] [I2] = x                (6.6)
The equilibrium constant for the reverse 
reaction, 2HI(g)  H2(g) + I2(g), at the same 
temperature is,
K′
c = [H2] [I2] / [HI]2 = 1/ x = 1 / Kc                (6.7)
Thus, K′
c = 1 / Kc                                                    (6.8)
Equilibrium constant for the reverse 
reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium 
constant for the reaction in the forward direction.
If we change the stoichiometric coefficients 
in a chemical equation by multiplying throughout by a factor then we must make sure that the expression for equilibrium constant also reflects that change. For example, if the  reaction (6.5) is written as,
½ H
2(g) + ½ I2(g)  HI(g)                   (6.9)
the equilibrium constant for the above 
reaction is given by
K″c   =  [HI] / [H2]1/2[I2]1/2 = {[HI]2 / [H2][I2]}1/2 
                                = x1/2 = Kc1/2 (6.10)
On multiplying the equation (6.5) by n, we getta b l e  6 . 3  Expression involving the

that because the equilibrium constants Kc

In a homogeneous system, all the reactants 
and products are in the same phase. For example, in the gaseous reaction,  
N
2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g), reactants and 
products are in the homogeneous phase. Similarly, for the reactions,
CH
3COOC2H5 (aq) + H2O (l)  CH3COOH (aq)    
                    + C2H5OH (aq)
and, Fe3+ (aq) + SCN–(aq)  Fe(SCN)2+ (aq)                                                                   
all the react ants and products are in 
homogeneous solution phase. We shall now 
consider equilibrium constant for some homogeneous reactions.
6.4.1  Equilibrium Constant in Gaseous 
Systems
So far we have expressed equilibrium 
constant of the reactions in terms of molar concentration of the reactants and products, and used symbol, K
c for it. For reactions 
involving gases, however, it is usually more convenient to express the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressure.
The ideal gas equation is written as,
pV = n RT 
⇒pn
VT =R
Here, p is the pressure in Pa, n is the number 
of moles of the gas, V is the volume in m3 and 
T is the temperature in Kelvin

chemistry
Therefore, 
n/V is concentration expressed  in mol/m3
If concentration c, is in mol/L or mol/d m3, 
and p is in bar then
p = cRT,We can also write p = [gas]RT.
Here, R= 0.0831 bar litre/mol K
At constant temperature, the pressure of 
the gas is proportional to its concentration i.e.,p 
∝ [gas]For reaction in equilibrium

Calculate equilibrium concentrations of CO2, 
H2, CO and H2O at 800 K, if only CO and 
H2O are present initially at concentrations 
of 0.10M each.
Solution
For the reaction,
    CO (g)  +    H2O (g)  CO2 (g) + H2 (g)
Initial concentration: 
     0.1M        0.1M             0         0

x2 = 4.24(0.01 + x2-0.2x)

x2 = (0.848 + 0.4118)/6.48  = 0.194the value 0.194 should be neglected because 
it will give concentration of the reactant which is more than initial concentration.
Hence the equilibrium concentrations are,

6.5 HEtErOGEnEOUS E qUilibri A
Equili
brium in a system having more than one

The equilibrium between water vapour and liquid water in a closed container is an example of heterogeneous equilibrium.

In this example, there is a gas phase and 
a liquid phase. In the same way, equilibrium between a solid and its saturated solution,
Ca(OH)
2 (s) + (aq)  Ca2+ (aq) + 2OH–(aq)
is a heterogeneous equilibrium.
Heterogeneous equilibria often involve 
pure solids or liquids. We can simplify 
equilibrium expressions for the heterogeneous equilibria involving a pure liquid or a pure solid, as the molar concentration of a pure solid or liquid is constant (i.e., independent of the amount present). In other words if a substance ‘X’ is involved, then [X(s)] and [X(l)] are constant, whatever the amount of ‘X’ is taken. Contrary to this, [X(g)] and [X(aq)] will

CaCO

Since [CaCO3(s)] and [CaO(s)] are both

temperature, there is a constant concentration or pressure of CO
2 in equilibrium with CaO(s) 
and CaCO3(s). Experimentally it has been 
found that at 1100 K, the pressure of CO2 
in equilibrium with CaCO3(s) and CaO(s), is  
2.0 ×105 Pa. Therefore, equilibrium constant 
at 1100K for the above reaction is:
Kp = PCO2 = 2 × 105 Pa/105 Pa = 2.00
Similarly, in the equilibrium between 
nickel, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl (used in the purification of nickel),

It must be remembered that for the 
existence of heterogeneous equilibrium pure 
solids or liquids must also be present (however small the amount may be) at equilibrium, but their concentrations or partial pressures do not appear in the expression of the equilibrium constant. In the reaction,Ag

32HNOUnits of Equilibrium Constant
The value of equilibrium constant Kc can be 
calculated by substituting the concentration terms in mol/L and for K
p partial pressure 
is substituted in Pa, kPa, bar or atm. This results in units of equilibrium constant based on molarity or pressure, unless the exponents of both the numerator and denominator are same.
For the reactions,
H
2(g) + I2(g)  2HI, Kc and Kp have no 
unit.
N2O4(g)  2NO2 (g), Kc has unit mol/L 
and Kp has unit bar
Equilibrium constants can also be 
expressed as dimensionless quantities if the 
standard state of reactants and products are specified. For a pure gas, the standard state is 1bar. Therefore a pressure of 4 bar in standard state can be expressed as 4 bar/1 bar = 4, which is a dimensionless number. Standard state (c
0) for a solute is 1 
molar solution and all concentrations can be measured with respect to it. The numerical value of equilibrium constant depends on the standard state chosen. Thus, in this system both K
p and Kc are dimensionless quantities 
but have different numerical values due to different standard states. Problem 6.6
The value of Kp for the reaction, 
CO2 (g) + C (s)  2CO (g)

pressures of CO and CO2.

for a reaction 
is related to the equilibrium constant 
of the corresponding reaction, whose equation is obtained by multiplying or dividing the equation for the original reaction by a small integer.
Let us consider applications of equilibrium 
constant to:
•	predict the extent of a reaction on the 
basis of its magnitude,
•	predict the direction of the reaction, and
•	calculate equilibrium concentrations.
6.6.1  Predicting the Extent of a 
reaction
The numerical valu
e of the equilibrium 
constant for a reaction indicates the extent of the reaction. But it is important to note that an equilibrium constant does not give any information about the rate at which the equilibrium is reached. The magnitude of K
c or Kp is directly proportional to the 
concentrations of products (as these appear in the numerator of equilibrium constant expression) and inversely proportional to the concentrations of the reactants (these appear in the denominator). This implies that a high value of K is suggestive of a high concentration 
of products and vice-versa.
We can make the following generalisations 
concerning the composition of equilibrium mixtures:
•	If Kc > 103, products predominate over 
reactants, i.e., if Kc is very large, the 
reaction proceeds nearly to completion. Consider the following examples:
(a) 
 The reaction of H2 with O2 at 500 K 
has a very large equilibrium constant,  
Kc = 2.4 × 1047.
(b)  H2(g) + Cl2(g)  2HCl(g) at 300K has  
Kc = 4.0 × 1031. 
(c) H2(g) + Br2(g)  2HBr (g) at 300 K,  
Kc = 5.4 × 1018
•	If Kc < 10–3, reactants predominate over 
products, i.e., if Kc is very small, the 
reaction proceeds rarely. Consider the following examples:6.6 APPliCAtiOnS OF E qUilibri Um 
COnStAntS
Before considering the applications of equilibrium constants, 
let us summarise the 
important features of equilibrium constants as follows:
1.
 Expression for equilibrium constant is 
applicable only when concentrations of the reactants and 
products have attained 
constant value at equilibrium state.
2. The value of equilibrium constant is independent of initial concentrations of
 
the reactants and products.
3. Equilibri
um constant is temperature 
dependent having one unique value for 
a particular reaction represented by a balanced equation at a given temperature.
4.
 The equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction is equal to the inverse of the
 
equilibrium constant for the forward reaction.

chemistry
(a)  The decomposition of H2O into H2 and 
O2 at 500 K has a very small equilibrium 
constant, Kc = 4.1 × 10–48
(b) N2(g)  +  O2(g)  2NO(g),  
at 298 K has Kc = 4.8 ×10–31.
•	If Kc is in the range of 10–3 to 103, 
appreciable concentrations of both 
reactants and products are present. Consider the following examples:
(a) 
 For reaction of H2 with I2 to give HI, 
 Kc = 57.0 at 700K.
(b)  Also, gas phase decomposition of N2O4 
to NO2 is another reaction with a value 
of Kc = 4.64 × 10–3 at 25°C which is 
neither too small nor too large. Hence, equilibrium mixtures contain appreciable concentrations of both N
2O4 and NO2.
 These generarlisations are illustrated in Fig. 6.6If Q
c = Kc, the reaction mixture is already 
at equilibrium.
Consider the gaseous reaction of H2  
with I2,
H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.
Suppose we have molar concentrations 
[H2]t=0.10M, [I2]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.
(the subscript t on the concentration symbols means that the concentrations were measured at some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at equilibrium). 
Thus, the reaction quotient, Q
c at this 
stage of the reaction is given by,Q
c = [HI]t2 / [H2]t [I2]t  = (0.40)2/ (0.10)×(0.20) 
                           = 8.0
Now, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal 
Kc (57.0), so the mixture of H2(g), I2(g) and HI(g) 
is not at equilibrium; that is, more H2(g) and 
I2(g) will react to form more HI(g) and their 
concentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.
The reaction quotient, Qc is useful in 
predicting the direction of reaction by 
comparing the values of Qc and Kc.
Thus, we can make the following 
generalisations concerning the direction of 
the reaction (Fig. 6.7) :Fig.6.6  Dependence of extent of reaction on Kc 
6.6.2  Predicting the Direction of the 
reaction
The equilibrium constant helps 
in predicting 
the direction in which a given reaction will 
proceed at any stage. For this purpose, we calculate the reaction quotient Q . 
The reaction quotient, Q  (Q
c with molar 
concentrations and QP with partial pressures) 
is defined in the same way as the equilibrium constant K
c except that the concentrations 
in Qc are not necessarily equilibrium values.  
For a general reaction:
a A + b B    c C + d D         (6.19)
Qc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                  (6.20)
Then, 
If Qc > Kc, the reaction will proceed in the 
direction of reactants (reverse reaction).
If Qc < Kc, the reaction will proceed in the 
direction of the products (forward reaction).Fig. 6.7  Predicting the direction of the reaction
•	If Qc < Kc, net reaction goes from left to 
right
•	If Qc > Kc, net reaction goes from right to

•	If Qc = Kc, no net reaction occurs.

6.6.3  Calculating  Equilibrium 
Concentrations
In case of a problem in which we know the initial concentrations but do not know any of the equilibrium concentrations, the following three steps shall be followed:
Step 1. Write the balanced equation for 
the 
reaction.Step 2. Under the balanced equation, make 
a table that lists for each substance involved in the reaction:
(a)
 the initial concentration,
(b) the change in concentration on going to 
equilibrium, and
(c) the equilibrium concentration.
In constructing the table, 
define x as the 
concentration (mol/L) of one of the substances 
that reacts on going to equilibrium, then use the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine the concentrations of the other substances in terms of x.
Step 3. Substitute the equilibrium 
concentrations into the equilibrium equation 
for the reaction and solve for x. If you are to solve a quadratic equation choose the mathematical solution that makes chemical sense.
Step 4. Calculate the equilibrium 
concentrations from the calculated value of x.
Step 5. Check your results by substituting 
them into the equilibrium equation.

Hence, using the equation (6.23), the 
reaction spontaneity can be interpreted in 
terms of the value of ∆G .
•	If ∆G  < 0, then –∆ G /RT is positive, 
and e –∆DG /RT>1, making K >1, which 
implies a spontaneous reaction or the 
reaction which proceeds in the forward direction to such an extent that the 
products are present predominantly.
•	If ∆G  > 0, then –∆G  /RT is negative, and  
e –∆G </RT 1, that is , K < 1, which implies 
a non-spontaneous reaction or a reaction which proceeds in the forward direction to such a small degree that only a very minute quantity of product is formed.

the value of Kc at 298 K.
Solution
∆G  = 13.8 kJ/mol = 13.8 × 103J/mol
Also, ∆G   = – RT lnKc
Hence, ln Kc = –13.8 × 103J/mol

The value of Kc for a reaction does not depend 
on the rate of the reaction. However, as you 
have studied in Unit 5, it is directly related  
to the thermodynamics of the reaction and  
in particular, to the change in Gibbs energy, ∆G. If,
•	∆G is negative, then the reaction is 
spontaneous and proceeds in the forward 
direction.
•	∆G is positive, then reaction is considered non-spontaneous. Instead, as reverse reaction would have a negative ∆ G, the 
products of the forward reaction shall be converted to the reactants.
•	∆G is 0, reaction has achieved equilibrium; 
at this point, there is no longer any free energy left to drive the reaction.
A mathematical expression of this 
thermodynamic view of equilibrium can be 
described by the following equation:
∆G  = ∆G
 + RT lnQ                                     (6.21)
where, G is standard Gibbs energy. 
At equilibrium, when ∆G = 0 and Q = Kc, 
the equation (6.21) becomes,
∆G = ∆G + RT ln K = 0
∆G = – RT lnK                                      (6.22)

of concentration for the reactants 
and products in the reaction,  
H2(g) + I2 (g)  2HI(g)reactants to products while minimising the 
expenditure of energy. This implies maximum yield of products at mild temperature and pressure conditions. If it does not happen, then the experimental conditions need to be adjusted. For example, in the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia from N
2 and 
H2, the choice of experimental conditions is 
of real economic importance. Annual world  production of ammonia is about hundred million tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.
Equilibrium constant, K
c is independent 
of initial concentrations. But if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change in the concentration of one or more of the reacting substances, then the system is no longer at equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in some direction until the system returns to equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change in temperature or pressure of the system may also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide what course the reaction adopts and make a qualitative prediction about the effect of a change in conditions on equilibrium we use Le Chatelier’s principle. It states that a change in any of the factors that determine the equilibrium conditions of a system will cause the system to change in such a manner so as to reduce or to counteract the effect of the change. This is applicable to all physical and chemical equilibria. 
We shall now be discussing factors which 
can influence the equilibrium.
6.8.1
 Effect of Concentration Change
In general, w
hen equilibrium is disturbed 
by the addition/removal of any reactant/
products, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that:
•
 The concentration stress of an added  
reactant/product is relieved by net 
reaction in 
the direction that consumes 
the added substance.
• The concentration stress of a removed reactant/product is relieved by net reaction 
in the direction that replenishes 
the removed substance.
 or in other words, “When the concentration of any of the 
reactants 
or products in a reaction at 
equilibrium is changed, the composition 
of the equilibrium mixture changes so as to minimize the effect of concentration changes”.
 Let us take the reaction,
H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)
If H2 is added to the reaction mixture 
at equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the 
reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein H
2 is consumed, i.e.,  more of H2 and I2 react 
to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts in right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle which implies that in case of addition of a reactant/product, a new equilibrium will be set up in which the concentration of the reactant/product should be less than what it was after the addition but more than what it was in the original mixture.
The same point can be explained in terms 
of the reaction quotient, Q
c,
Qc = [HI]2/ [H2][I2]

chemistry
Addition of hydrogen at equilibrium 
results in value of Qc being less than Kc . Thus, 
in order to attain equilibrium again reaction 
moves in the forward direction. Similarly, we can say that removal of a product also boosts the forward reaction and increases the concentration of the products and this has great commercial application in cases of reactions, where the product is a gas or a volatile substance. In case of manufacture of ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed from the reaction mixture so that reaction keeps moving in forward direction. Similarly, in the large scale production of CaO (used as important building material) from CaCO
3, 
constant removal of CO2 from the kiln drives 
the reaction to completion. It should be remembered that continuous removal of a product maintains Q
c at a value less than Kc 
and reaction continues to move in the forward direction.
Effect of Concentration – An experiment
This can be demonstrated by the following 
reaction: 
Fe
3+(aq)+ SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)        (6.24)
yellow      colourless      deep red
        (6.25)
A reddish colour appears on adding two 
drops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution
 
to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due 
to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+. The intensity 
of the red colour becomes constant on attaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be shifted in either forward or reverse directions depending on our choice of adding a reactant or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted in the opposite direction by adding reagents that remove Fe
3+ or SCN– ions. For example, 
oxalic acid (H2C2O4), reacts with Fe3+ ions 
to form the stable complex ion [Fe(C2O4)3]3–, 
thus decreasing the concentration of free Fe
3+(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier’s 
principle, the concentration stress of removed Fe
3+ is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ 
to replenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the 
intensity of red colour decreases.
Addition of aq. HgCl2 also decreases red 
colour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to 
form stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)4]2–. Removal 
of free SCN– (aq) shifts the equilibrium 
in equation (6.24) from right to left to 
replenish SCN– ions.  Addition of potassium 
thiocyanate on the other hand increases the colour intensity of the solution as it shift the equilibrium to right.
6.8.2
 Effect of Pressure Change
A pressure change obtained by changing the 
volume can affect the yield of products in case of
 a gaseous reaction where the total 
number of moles of gaseous reactants and total number of moles of gaseous products are different. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle to a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect of pressure changes on solids and liquids can be ignored because the volume (and concentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly independent of pressure.
Consider the reaction,
CO(g) + 3H
2(g)  CH4(g) + H2O(g)
Here, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H2) 
become 2 mol of gaseous products (CH4 + 
H2O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above 
reaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston 
at constant temperature is compressed to one half of its original volume. Then, total pressure will be doubled (according to  
pV = constant). The partial pressure and therefore, concentration of reactants and products have changed and the mixture is no longer at equilibrium. The direction in which the reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s principle. Since pressure has doubled, the equilibrium now shifts in the forward direction, a direction in which the number of moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we know pressure is proportional to moles of the gas). This can also be understood by using reaction quotient, Q
c. Let [CO], [H2], [CH4] 
and [H2O] be the molar concentrations at 
equilibrium for methanation reaction. When 
volume of the reaction mixture is halved, the

double its value.

As Qc < Kc , the reaction proceeds in the 
forward direction.
In reaction C(s) + CO2(g)  2CO(g), when 
pressure is increased, the reaction goes in the 
reverse direction because the number of moles of gas increases in the forward direction.
6.8.3
 Effect of Inert Gas Addition
If the volume is kept constant and an inert gas 
such as argon is added which does not take part in the reaction, the equilibrium remains un
disturbed. It is because the addition of 
an inert gas at constant volume does not change the partial pressures or the molar concentrations of the substance involved in the reaction. The reaction quotient changes only if the added gas is a reactant or product involved in the reaction.
6.8.4
 Effect of Temperature Change
Whenever an equilibrium is disturbed by 
a change in the concentration, pressure or volume, the composition 
of the equilibrium 
mixture changes because the reaction quotient, Q
c no longer equals the equilibrium 
constant, Kc. However, when a change in 
temperature occurs, the value of equilibrium constant, K
c  is changed.
In general, the temperature dependence 
of the equilibrium constant depends on the 
sign of ∆H for the reaction.
•	The equilibrium constant for an exothermic 
reaction (negative ∆H) decreases as the 
temperature increases.
•	The equilibrium constant for an endothermic reaction (positive ∆H) 
increases as the temperature increases.
Temperature changes affect the 
equilibrium constant and rates of reactions. Production of ammonia according to the 
reaction,
N
2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g); 
∆H= – 92.38 kJ mol–1
is an exothermic process. According to  
Le Chatelier’s principle, raising the 
temperature shifts the equilibrium to left and decreases the equilibrium concentration of ammonia. In other words, low temperature is favourable for high yield of ammonia, but practically very low temperatures slow down the reaction and thus a catalyst is used.
Effect of Temperature – An experiment
Effect of temperature on equilibrium can 
be demonstrated by taking NO
2 gas (brown 
in colour) which dimerises into N2O4 gas 
(colourless).
2NO2(g)  N2O4(g); ∆H = –57.2 kJ mol–1
NO2 gas prepared by addition of Cu 
turnings to conc. HNO3 is collected in two  
5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity of colour of gas in each tube) and stopper sealed with araldite. Three 250 mL beakers 1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water at room temperature and hot water (363K), respectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test tubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes. After this one is placed in beaker 1 and the other in beaker  3. The effect of temperature on direction of reaction is depicted very well in this experiment. At low temperatures in beaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of N
2O4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, 
and thus, intensity of brown colour due to NO
2 decreases. While in beaker 3, high 
temperature favours the reverse reaction of

formation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour 
intensifies.
Effect of temperature can also be seen in 
an endothermic reaction,
[Co(H2O)6]3+(aq) + 4Cl–(aq) [CoCl4 ]2–(aq) +   
                                                               6H2O(l)
 pink  colourless  blue
At room temperature, the equilibrium 
mixture is blue due to [CoCl4]2–. When cooled 
in a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture 
turns pink due to [Co(H2O)6]3+.
6.8.5  Effect of a Catalyst
A catalyst increases the rate of the chemical 
reaction by making available a new low energy pathway for 
the conversion of reactants to 
products. It increases the rate of forward and reverse reactions that pass through the same transition state and does not affect equilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation energy for the forward and reverse reactions by exactly the same amount. Catalyst does not affect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture. It does not appear in the balanced chemical equation or in the equilibrium constant expression.
Let us consider the formation of NH
3 
from dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is highly exothermic reaction and proceeds with decrease in total number of moles formed as compared to the reactants. Equilibrium constant decreases with increase in temperature. At low temperature rate decreases and it takes long time to reach at equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give 
satisfactory rates but poor yields. 
German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered 
that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse 
the reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate at temperatures, where the equilibrium concentration of NH
3 is reasonably favourable. 
Since the number of moles formed in the reaction is less than those of reactants, the yield of NH
3 can be improved by increasing 
the pressure.
Optimum conditions of temperature 
and pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using 
catalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric 
acid by contact process,
2SO2(g) + O2(g)  2SO3(g);  Kc = 1.7 × 1026
though the value of K is suggestive of reaction 
going to completion, but practically the 
oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus, 
platinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2O5) 
is used as catalyst to increase the rate of the reaction.
Note: If a reaction has an exceedingly small 
K, a catalyst would be of little help.

 IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTION
Under the effect of change of concentration 
on the directi
on of equilibrium, you have 
incidently come across with the following 
equilibrium which involves ions:
Fe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)
There are numerous equilibria that involve 
ions only. In the following sections we will 
study the equilibria involving ions. It is well known that the aqueous solution of sugar does not conduct electricity. However, when common salt (sodium chloride) is added to water it conducts electricity. Also, the conductance of electricity increases with an increase in concentration of common salt. Michael Faraday classified the substances into two categories based on their ability to conduct electricity. One category of substances conduct electricity in their aqueous solutions and are called electrolytes  
while the other do not and are thus, referred to as non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified 
electrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes. 
Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water are ionized almost completely, while the weak electrolytes are only partially dissociated.  
For example, an aqueous solution of  
sodium chloride is comprised entirely of 
sodium ions and chloride ions, while that  
of acetic acid mainly contains unionized  
acetic acid molecules and only some acetate ions and hydronium ions. This is because  
there is almost 100% ionization in case of sodium chloride as compared to less  
than 5% ionization of acetic acid which is  
a weak electrolyte. It should be noted

Acids, bases and salts find widespread 
occurrence i
n nature. Hydrochloric acid 
present in the gastric juice is secreted by the lining of our stomach in a significant amount of 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive  processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main constituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange juices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and tartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As most of the acids taste sour, the word “acid” has been derived from a latin word “acidus” meaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue litmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen on reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases are known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste bitter and feel soapy. A common example of a base is washing soda used for washing purposes. When acids and bases are mixed in the right proportion they react with each other to give salts. Some commonly known 
examples of salts are sodium chloride, barium sulphate, sodium nitrate.  Sodium chloride (common salt) is an important component of our diet and is formed by reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It exists in solid state as a cluster of positively 
charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions which are held together due to electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic forces between two charges are inversely proportional to dielectric constant of the medium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses a very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus, when sodium chloride is dissolved in water, the electrostatic interactions are reduced by a factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to move freely in the solution. Also, they are well-separated due to hydration with water molecules. 
Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of 
14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent.  During this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the leading scientists of the time.  In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal Institution
	laboratories, 	and	in	1833	he	also	became	the	first	Fullerian 	Professor 	of

much of his work was on electricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic phenomena.

molecules, former is completely ionized into 
its constituent ions, while the latter is only partially ionized (< 5%). The extent to which ionization occurs depends upon the strength of the bond and the extent of solvation of ions produced. The terms dissociation and ionization have earlier been used with different meaning. Dissociation refers to the process of separation of ions in water already existing as such in the solid state of the solute, as in sodium chloride. On the other hand, ionization corresponds to a process in which a neutral molecule splits into charged ions in the solution. Here, we shall not distinguish between the two and use the two terms interchangeably. 
6.10.1
 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and 
bases
According to Arrhenius theory, acids are
 
substances that dissociates in water to 
give hydrogen ions H+(aq) and bases are 
substances that produce hydroxyl ions  
OH–(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can 
be represented by the following equations:
HX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)
or
HX(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + X –(aq)
A bare proton, H+ is very reactive and 
cannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. 
Thus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent water molecule to give trigonal pyramidal  
hydronium ion, H
3O+ {[H (H2O)]+} (see box). In 
this chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) 
interchangeably to mean the same i.e., a hydrated proton. 
Similarly, a base molecule like MOH 
ionizes in aqueous solution according to the equation:
MOH(aq) → M
+(aq) + OH–(aq)
The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated form in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius concept of acid and base, however, suffers from the limitation of being applicable only to aqueous solutions and also, does not account for the basicity of substances like, ammonia which do not possess a hydroxyl group.6.10.2
 the brönsted- lowry Acids and 
bases
The Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and 
the English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave a more 
general definition of acids and bases. 
According to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid 
is a substance that is capable of donating a hydrogen ion H
+ and bases are substances 
capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H+. In 
short, acids are proton donors and bases are proton acceptors. 
Consider the example of dissolution of NH
3 
in H2O represented by the following equation:Hydronium and Hydroxyl ions
Hydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very 
small size (~10–15 m radius) and intense electric 
field, binds itself with the water molecule at one of the two available lone pairs on it giving H
3O+. This species has been detected in many 
compounds (e.g., H3O+Cl–) in the solid state. In 
aqueous solution the hydronium ion is further hydrated to give species like H
5O2+, H7O3+ and 
H9O4+. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated 
to give several ionic species like H3O2–, H5O3– 
and H7O4– etc.
The basic solution is formed due to the 
presence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction, 
water molecule acts as proton donor and ammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor and are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and H9O4+

EQUILIBRIUM
Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the 
conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884.  For the next
	five	years	he	travelled 	extensively 	and	visited	a	number	of	research 	centers	
in Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed University of Stockholm, 
serving its rector from 1897 to 1902.  From 1905 until his 
death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm.  He continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions.  In 1899 he discussed the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now usually known as Arrhenius equation.
He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to 
immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was the
	first	to	discuss	the	‘green	house	effect’	calling	by	that	name.	He	received 	Nobel	
Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for 
his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in 
the development of chemistry.
base, respectively. In the reverse reaction, 
H+ is transferred from NH4+ to OH–. In this 
case, NH4+ acts as a Bronsted acid while 
OH– acted as a Brönsted base. The acid-base 
pair that differs only by one proton is called a conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH
– 
is called the conjugate base of an acid H2O 
and NH4+ is called conjugate acid of the base 
NH3. If Brönsted acid is a strong acid then 
its conjugate base is a weak base and vice-
versa. It may be noted that conjugate acid 
has one extra proton and each conjugate base has one less proton.
Consider the example of ionization of 
hydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as an acid by donating a proton to H
2O molecule 
which acts as a base.in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by donating a proton.
Problem 6.12
What will be the conjugate bases for the 
following Brönsted acids: HF, H
2SO4 and 
HCO3– ?
Solution
The conjugate bases should have one 
proton less in each case and therefore the corresponding conjugate bases are: F
–, 
HSO4– and CO32– respectively.
Problem 6.13
Write the conjugate acids for the following 
Brönsted bases: NH2–, NH3 and HCOO–.
Solution
The conjugate acid should have one extra 
proton in each case and therefore the corresponding conjugate acids are: NH
3, 
NH4+ and HCOOH respectively.
Problem 6.14
The species: H2O, HCO3–, HSO4– and NH3 can 
act both as Bronsted acids and bases. For 
each case give the corresponding conjugate acid and conjugate base.
Solution
The answer is given in the following Table:

(1859-1927)
It can be seen in the above equation, that 
water acts as a base because it accepts the 
proton. The species H3O+ is produced when 
water accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore, Cl

conjugate acid of base Cl–. Similarly, H2O is 
a conjugate base of an acid H3O+ and H3O+ is 
a conjugate acid of base H2O.
It is interesting to observe the dual role 
of water as an acid and a base. In case of reaction with HCl water acts as a base while

6.10.3  lewis Acids and bases
G.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as 
a 
species which accepts electron pair and base 
which donates an electron pair. As far as bases are concerned, there is not much difference between Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts, as the base provides a lone pair in both the cases. However, in Lewis concept many acids do not have proton. A typical example is reaction of electron deficient species BF
3 
with NH3.
BF3 does not have a proton but still acts 
as an acid and reacts with NH3 by accepting 
its lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be represented by,
BF
3 + :NH3 → BF3:NH3
Electron deficient species  like AlCl3, Co3+, 
Mg2+, etc.  can act as Lewis acids while species 
like H2O, NH3, OH– etc. which can donate a 
pair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.
Problem 6.15
Classify the following species into Lewis 
acids and Lewis bases and show how these act as such:
(a) HO
– (b) F–       (c) H+  (d) BCl3
Solution 
(a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can 
donate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).
(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base as it can donate any one of its 
four 
electron lone pairs.
(c) A proton is a Lewis acid 
as it can 
accept a lone pair of electrons from bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride ion.
(d) 
 BCl3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can 
accept a lone pair of electrons from species like ammonia or amine molecules.

Arrhenius concept of 
acids and bases 
becomes useful in case of ionization of acids and bases as mostly ionizations in chemical and biological systems occur in aqueous medium. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO
4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic 
acid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO
3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed 
strong because they are almost completely dissociated into their constituent ions in an aqueous medium, thereby acting as proton (H
+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like 
lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium hydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide Ba(OH)
2 are almost completely dissociated 
into ions in an aqueous medium giving hydroxyl ions, OH
–. According to Arrhenius 
concept they are strong acids and bases as they are able to completely dissociate and produce H
3O+
 and OH– ions respectively in 
the medium. Alternatively, the strength of an acid or base may also be gauged in terms of Brönsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases, wherein a strong acid means a good proton donor and a strong base implies a good proton acceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation equilibrium of a weak acid HA,
HA(aq)  +  H
2O(l)   H3O+(aq)  +  A–(aq)
                                     conjugate    conjugate
acid         base              acid            base
In section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or 
base) 
dissociation equilibrium is dynamic 
involving a transfer of proton in forward and 
reverse directions. Now, the question arises that if the equilibrium is dynamic then with passage of time which direction is favoured? What is the driving force behind it? In order to answer these questions we shall deal into the issue of comparing the strengths of the two acids (or bases) involved in the dissociation equilibrium. Consider the two acids HA and H
3O+ present in the above 
mentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium. We have to see which amongst them is a stronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds in its tendency of donating a proton over the other shall be termed as the stronger acid and the equilibrium will shift in the direction of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid than H
3O+, then HA will donate protons and 
not H3O+, and the solution will mainly contain 
A– and H3O+ ions. The equilibrium moves in 
the direction of formation of weaker acid

EQUILIBRIUM
and weaker base because the stronger acid 
donates a proton to the stronger base . 
It follows that 
as a strong acid dissociates 
completely in water, the resulting base formed would be very weak i.e., strong acids have 
very weak conjugate bases. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO
4), hydrochloric acid 
(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO
3) and sulphuric acid 
(H2SO4) will give conjugate base ions ClO4–, Cl, 
Br–, I–, NO3– and HSO4– , which are much weaker 
bases than H2O. Similarly a very strong base 
would give a very weak conjugate acid. On the other hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially dissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the solution mainly contains undissociated HA molecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous acid (HNO
2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic 
acid (CH3COOH). It should be noted that the 
weak acids have very strong conjugate bases. For example, NH
2–, O2– and H– are very good 
proton acceptors and thus, much stronger bases than H
2O. 
Certain water soluble organic compounds 
like phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue behave as weak acids and exhibit different colours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base (In
– ) forms.

6.11.1  the ionization Constant of Water 
and its ionic Product
Some substances like water are unique in
 
their ability of acting both as an acid and a 
base. We have seen this in case of water in section 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it accepts a proton and acts as the base while in the presence of a base, B
– it acts as an 
acid by donating a proton. In pure water, one H
2O molecule donates proton and acts as an 
acid and another water molecules accepts a proton and acts as a base at the same time.   
The following equilibrium exists:H
2O(l)  +  H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)  +   OH–(aq)
acid        base         conjugate       conjugate
                          acid                base
The dissociation constant is represented by,
K = [H3O+] [OH–] / [H2O]                    (6.26)
The concentration of water is omitted from 
the denominator as water is a pure liquid and 
its concentration remains constant. [H2O] is 
incorporated within the equilibrium constant  
to give a new constant, Kw, which is called the 
ionic product of water. 
 Kw = [H+][OH–]            (6.27)
The concentration of H+ has been found 
out experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K. 
And, as dissociation of water produces equal number of H
+ and OH– ions, the concentration 
of hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M.  
Thus, the value of Kw at 298K,
Kw = [H3O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)2 = 1 × 10–14 M2 
(6.28)
The value of Kw is temperature dependent 
as it is an equilibrium constant.
The density of pure water is 1000 g / L 
and its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this the molarity of pure water can be given as,
[H
2O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M. 
Therefore, the ratio of dissociated water to 
that of undissociated water can be given as:
10–7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 10–9 or  ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus, 
equilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated 
water)
We can distinguish acidic, neutral and 
basic aqueous solutions by the relative values 
of the H3O+ and OH– concentrations:
Acidic: [H3O+] > [OH– ]
Neutral: [H3O+] = [OH– ]
Basic : [H3O+] < [OH–]
6.11.2  the pH Scale
Hydronium ion concentration in 
molarity is 
more conveniently expressed on a logarithmic 
scale known as the pH scale. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm 
to base 10 of the activity 
aH/unif02b/unif028/unif029  of hydrogen

chemistry
ion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity 
of hydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude 
to molarity represented by [H+]. It should  
be noted that activity has no units and is 
defined as:
  = [H+] / mol L–1
From the definition of pH, the following 
can be written,
pH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}
Thus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M) 
will have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution 
of NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H3O+] =  
10–10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure 
water has a concentration of hydrogen ions,  
[H+] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is 
given as:
pH = –log(10–7) = 7
Acidic solutions possess a concentration 
of hydrogen ions, [H+] > 10–7 M, while basic 
solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen ions, [H
+] < 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise 
thatAcidic solution has pH < 7
Basic solution has pH > 7Neutral solution has pH = 7
Now again, consider the equation (6.28) 
at 298 K
K
w = [H3O+] [OH–] = 10–14
Taking negative logarithm on both sides 
of equation, we obtain
–log Kw = – log {[H3O+] [OH–]} 
             = – log [H3O+] – log [OH–] 
            = – log 10–14
   pKw  =   pH  +  pOH   =   14             (6.29)
Note that although Kw may change 
with temperature the variations in pH with 
temperature are so small that we often  
ignore it.
pKw is a very important quantity for 
aqueous solutions and controls the relative 
concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions as their product is a constant. It should be noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, a change in pH by just one unit also means change in [H
+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] 
changes by a factor of 100, the value of pH changes by 2 units. Now you can realise why the change in pH with temperature is often ignored.
Measurement of pH of a solution is very 
essential as its value should be known when dealing with biological and cosmetic applications. The pH of a solution can be found roughly with the help of pH paper that has different colour in solutions of different pH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with four strips on it. The different strips have different colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH. The pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined with an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper. 
Fig.6.11  pH-paper with four strips that may have 
different colours at the same pH
For greater accuracy pH meters are used. 
pH meter is a device that measures the  
pH-dependent electrical potential of the test 
solution within 0.001 precision. pH meters of the size of a writing pen are now available in the market. The pH of some very common substances are given in Table 6.5 (page 195).
Problem 6.16
The concentration of hydrogen ion in a 
sample of soft drink is 3.8 × 10
–3M. what 
is its pH ?
Solution
pH = – log[3.8 × 10–3] 
      = – {log[3.8] + log[10–3]}
      = – {(0.58) + (– 3.0)} = – { – 2.42} = 2.42
Therefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42 and it can be inferred that it is acidic.

the ionization of HCl dissolved i.e., 
HCl(aq)  + H2O(l)  H3O+ (aq)  +  Cl –(aq),  
and (ii) from ionization of H2O. In these very 
dilute solutions, both sources of H3O+ must 
be considered:[H

Kw = (10–8 + x)(x) = 10–14 
or x2 + 10–8 x – 10–14 = 0

So, pOH = 7.02 and pH = 6.98

Here, c = initial concentration 
of the 
undissociated acid, HX at time, t = 0. α = 
extent up to which HX is ionized into ions. 
Using these notations, we can derive the equilibrium constant for the above discussed acid-dissociation equilibrium:
K
a = c2α2 / c(1-α) = cα2 / 1-α
Ka is called the dissociation or ionization 
constant  of acid HX. It can be represented 
alternatively in terms of molar concentration as follows,
   Ka = [H+][X–] / [HX]          (6.30)
At a given temperature T , Ka is a 
measure of the strength of the acid HX i.e., larger the value of K
a, the stronger is the 
acid. Ka is a dimensionless quantity with 
the understanding that the standard state concentration of all species is 1M.
The values of the ionization constants 
of some selected weak acids are given in

quantities. Thus, we have:
pKa = –log (Ka)                                   (6.31)
Knowing the ionization constant, Ka 
of an acid and its initial concentration, c, 
it is possible to calculate the equilibrium concentration of all species and also the 
degree of ionization of the acid and the pH of 
the solution.
A general step-wise approach can be 
adopted to evaluate the pH of the weak electrolyte as follows:
Step 1 . The species present before 
dissociation are identified as Brönsted-Lowry  
acids/bases.
Step 2. Balanced equations for all possible 
reactions i.e., with a species acting both as 
acid as well as base are written.
Step 3. The reaction with the higher K
a is 
identified as the primary reaction whilst the 
other is a subsidiary reaction.

values for each of the species in the primary reaction

 Initial concentration, c.
(b) Change in concentration on proceeding

itute equilibrium concentrations 
into equilibrium constant equation for principal reaction and solve for α.
Step 6.  Calculate the concentration of species in principal reaction.

The above mentioned methodology has

Substituting equilibrium concentrations 
in the equilibrium reaction for principal reaction gives:
K
a = (0.02α)2 / (0.02 – 0.02α) 
= 0.02 α2 / (1 –α) = 3.2 × 10–4
We obtain the following quadratic equation:α
2 + 1.6 × 10–2α – 1.6 × 10–2 = 0
The quadratic equation in α can be solved 
and the two values of the roots are:α = + 0.12 and – 0.12The negative root is not acceptable and 
hence,
α = 0.12This means that the degree of ionization, 
α = 0.12, then equilibrium concentrations of other species viz., HF, F

given by:
[H3O+] = [F –] = cα = 0.02 × 0.12

Therefore,Percent dissociation

6.11.4  ionization of Weak bases
The ioni
zation of base MOH can be represented 
by equation:
MOH(aq)   M+(aq) + OH–(aq)
In a weak base there is partial ionization 
of MOH into M+ and OH–, the case is similar 
to that of acid-dissociation equilibrium. The 
equilibrium constant for base ionization is called base ionization constant and is represented by K
b. It can be expressed in 
terms of concentration in molarity of various species in equilibrium by the following equation:
K
b = [M+][OH–] / [MOH]          (6.33)
Alternatively, if c = initial 
concentration 
of base and α = degree of ionization of base 
i.e. the extent to which the base ionizes. When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium constant can be written as:
K
b = (cα)2 / c (1- α) = c α2 / (1-α)
The values of the ionization constants of 
some selected weak bases, Kb are given in  
Table 6.7.
Many organic compounds like amines  
are weak bases. Amines are derivatives of 
ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by another group. For example, methylamine, codeine, quinine and

chemistry
nicotine all behave as very weak bases due to 
their very small Kb. Ammonia produces OH– in 
aqueous solution:
NH3(aq) + H2O(l)   NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)
The pH scale for the hydrogen ion 
concentration has been extended to get:
pKb = –log ( Kb)             (6.34)
Problem 6.21 
The pH of 0.004M hydrazine solution is 9.7. 
Calculate its ionization constant Kb and pKb.
Solution 
NH2NH2  +  H2O   NH2NH3+   +   OH–
From the pH we can calculate the hydrogen 
ion concentration. Knowing hydrogen ion concentration and the ionic product of 
water we can calculate the concentration 
of hydroxyl ions. Thus we have:
[H
+] = antilog (–pH) 
=  antilog (–9.7) = 1.67 ×10–10
[OH–] = Kw / [H+] = 1 × 10–14 / 1.67 × 10–10 
                  = 5.98 × 10–5
The concentration of the corresponding 
hydrazinium ion is also the same as that of hydroxyl ion. The concentration of both these ions is very small so the concentration of the undissociated base can be taken equal to 0.004M.
Thus,K
b = [NH2NH3+][OH–] / [NH2NH2] 
= (5.98 × 10–5)2 / 0.004 = 8.96 × 10–7
pKb = –logKb = –log(8.96 × 10–7) = 6.04.
Problem 6.22
Calculate the pH of the solution in which  
0.2M NH4Cl and 0.1M NH3 are present. The 
pKb of ammonia solution is 4.75.

b = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3]
 = (0.20 + x)(x) / (0.1 – x) = 1.77 × 10–5
As Kb is small, we can neglect x in comparison 
to 0.1M and 0.2M. Thus,[OH
–] = x = 0.88 × 10–5
Therefore, [H+] = 1.12 × 10–9
pH = – log[H+] = 8.95.
6.11.5  relation between Ka and Kb
As seen earlier in this chapter, Ka and Kb 
represent the strength of an acid and a base, 
respectively. In case of a conjugate acid-base pair, they are related in a simple manner so that if one is known, the other can be deduced. Considering the example of NH
4+ and NH3  
we see,
NH4+(aq) + H2O(l)   H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)
  Ka = [H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+] = 5.6 × 10–10
NH3(aq) + H2O(l)    NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)     
Kb =[ NH4+][ OH–] / NH3 = 1.8 × 10–5
Net: 2 H2O(l)    H3O+(aq) + OH–(aq)            
Kw = [H3O+][ OH– ] = 1.0 × 10–14 M
Where, Ka represents the strength of NH4+ 
as an acid and Kb represents the strength of 
NH3 as a base.
It can be seen from the net reaction that 
the equilibrium constant is equal to the 
product of equilibrium constants Ka and Kb 
for the reactions added. Thus,
Ka × Kb = {[H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+ ]} × {[NH4+]
                                         [OH–] / [NH3]}
= [H3O+][OH–] = Kw
= (5.6 ×10–10) × (1.8 × 10–5) = 1.0 × 10–14 M

EQUILIBRIUM
This can be extended to make a 
generalisation. the equil
ibrium constant 
for a net reaction obtained after adding 
two (or more) reactions equals the product of the equilibrium constants for individual reactions:
K
NET = K1 × K2 × ……                                   (6.35)
Similarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base 
pair,
Ka × Kb = Kw                                                             (6.36)
Knowing one, the other can be obtained. 
It should be noted that a strong acid will have a weak conjugate base and vice-versa.
Alternatively, the above expression  
K
w = Ka × Kb, can also be obtained by 
considering the base-dissociation equilibrium reaction:
B(aq) + H
2O(l)         BH+(aq) + OH–(aq)
Kb = [BH+][OH–] / [B] 
As the concentration of water remains 
constant it has been omitted from the denominator and incorporated within the dissociation constant. Then multiplying and dividing the above expression by [H
+], we get:
Kb = [BH+][OH–][H+] / [B][H+] 
     ={[ OH–][H+]}{[BH+] / [B][H+]}
    = Kw / Ka
or  Ka × Kb = Kw
It may be noted that if we take negative 
logarithm of both sides of the equation, then 
pK values of the conjugate acid and base are related to each other by the equation:
pK
a + pKb = pKw = 14 (at 298K)
Problem 6.23 
Determine the degree of ionization and pH of 
a 0.05M of ammonia solution. The ionization constant of ammonia can be taken from Table 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization constant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.
Solution 
The ionization of NH
3 in water is represented 
by equation:NH3  +  H2O           NH4+    +    OH–
We use equation (6.33) to calculate 
hydroxyl ion concentration,
[OH–] = c α = 0.05 α 
Kb = 0.05 α2 / (1 –  α)
The value of α  is small, therefore the 
quadratic equation can be simplified by 
neglecting α in comparison to 1 in the 
denominator on right hand side of the equation,
Thus,K
b = c α2  or   α = √ (1.77 × 10–5 / 0.05)
                 = 0.018.
[OH–] = c α = 0.05 × 0.018 = 9.4 × 10–4M.
[H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 / (9.4 × 10–4) 
                          = 1.06 × 10–11
pH = –log(1.06 × 10–11) = 10.97.
Now, using the relation for conjugate 
acid-base pair,
Ka × Kb = Kw
using the value of Kb of NH3 from  
Table 6.7.We can determine the concentration of 
conjugate acid NH
4+
Ka = Kw / Kb = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 
                    = 5.64 × 10–10.
6.11.6  Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di- 
and Polyacidic bases
Some of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acids have more than one ionizable proton
 per molecule of the 
acid. Such acids are known as polybasic or polyprotic acids.
The ionization reactions for example for 
a dibasic acid H
2X are represented by the 
equations:
H2X(aq)  H+(aq) + HX–(aq)
HX–(aq)  H+(aq) + X2–(aq)
And the corresponding equilibrium 
constants are given below:
Ka1= {[H+][HX–]} / [H2X] and
Unit 6.indd   199 9/12/2022   11:58:28 AM
Reprint 2025-26

chemistry
Ka2 = {[H+][X2-]} / [HX-]
Here, Ka1and Ka2are called the first and second 
ionization constants respectively of the acid H2 
X. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H3PO4 we 
have three ionization constants. The values 
of the ionization constants for some common polyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.In general, when strength of H-A bond 
decreases, that is, the energy required to break the bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger acid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more polar i.e., the electronegativity difference between the atoms H and A increases and there is marked charge separation, cleavage of the bond becomes easier thereby increasing the acidity.
But it should be noted that while comparing 
elements in the same group of the periodic table, H-A bond strength is a more important factor in determining acidity than its polar nature. As the size of A increases down the group, H-A bond strength decreases and so the acid strength increases. For example,
Size increases
HF << HCl << HBr << HI
Acid strength increases
Similarly, H
2S is stronger acid than H2O.
But, when we discuss elements in the same 
row of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity becomes the deciding factor for determining the acid strength. As the electronegativity of A increases, the strength of the acid also increases. For example,
Electronegativity of A increases
CH
4 < NH3 < H2O < HF
Acid strength increases
6.11.8  Common ion Effect in the 
ionization of Acids and bases
Consider an example of acetic acid dissociation equilibrium represented as:
CH
3COOH(aq)   H+(aq) +  CH3COO– (aq) 
or  HAc(aq)   H+ (aq) + Ac– (aq)
Ka = [H+][Ac– ] / [HAc]
Addition of acetate ions to an acetic 
acid solution results in decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H
+]. Also, 
if H+ ions are added from an external source 
then the equilibrium moves in the direction of undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction of reducing the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H
+]. This phenomenon is an example table 6.8  the ionization Constants of Some 
Common Polyprotic Acids (298K)
It can be seen that higher order ionization 
constants (Ka2, Ka3) are smaller than the 
lower order ionization constant (Ka1) of a 
polyprotic acid. The reason for this is that 
it is more difficult to remove a positively charged proton from a negative ion due to electrostatic forces. This can be seen in the case of removing a proton from the uncharged H
2CO3 as compared from a negatively charged 
HCO3–. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove 
a proton from a doubly charged HPO42– anion 
as compared to H2PO4–. 
Polyprotic acid solutions contain a 
mixture of acids like H2A, HA– and A2– in case 
of a diprotic acid. H2A being a strong acid, the 
primary reaction involves the dissociation of H
2 A, and H3O+ in the solution comes mainly 
from the first dissociation step.
6.11.7  Factors Affecting Acid Strength
Having discussed quantitatively the strengths 
of acids and bases, 
we come to a stage where 
we can calculate the pH of a given acid solution. But, the curiosity rises about why should some acids be stronger than others? What factors are responsible for making them stronger? The answer lies in its being a complex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking we can say that the extent of dissociation of an acid depends on the strength and polarity  
of the H-A bond.

EQUILIBRIUM
of common ion effect. It can be defined as 
a shift in equilibrium on adding a substance 
that provides more of an ionic species already present in the dissociation equilibrium. Thus, we can say that common ion effect is a phenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s principle discussed in section 6.8.
In order to evaluate the pH of the solution 
resulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to 0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider the acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once again,
 HAc(aq)  H+(aq)   +  Ac–(aq)
Initial concentration (M)
    0.05      0         0.05  
Let x be the extent of ionization of acetic 
acid.
Change in concentration (M)  
     –x       +x          +xEquilibrium concentration (M) 0.05-x      x      0.05+xTherefore, 
K
a= [H+][Ac– ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)
As Ka is small for a very weak acid, x<<0.05. 
Hence, (0.05 + x) ≈ (0.05 – x) ≈  0.05
Thus, 1.8 × 10
–5 = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 – x) 
= x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H+] = 1.8 × 10–5M
pH = – log(1.8 × 10–5) = 4.74
Problem 6.24 
Calculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia 
solution. Calculate the pH after 50.0 mL of this solution is treated with 25.0 mL of 0.10M HCl. The dissociation constant of ammonia, K
b = 1.77 × 10–5
Solution 
 NH3     +      H2O      →     NH4+    +    OH–
 Kb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3] = 1.77 × 10–5
Before neutralization,
[NH4+] = [OH–] = x
[NH3] = 0.10 – x   0.10
x2 / 0.10 = 1.77 × 10–5Thus, x = 1.33 × 10–3 = [OH–]
Therefore, [H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 / 
             (1.33 × 10–3) = 7.51 × 10–12
pH = –log (7.5 × 10–12) = 11.12
On addition of 25 mL of 0.1M HCl 
solution (i.e., 2.5 mmol of HCl) to 50 mL of 0.1M ammonia solution (i.e., 5 mmol of NH
3), 2.5 mmol of ammonia 
molecules are neutralized. The resulting 75 mL solution contains the remaining unneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH
3 molecules 
and 2.5 mmol of NH4+.
NH3    +    HCl    →    NH4+ +  Cl–
2.5           2.5              0          0
At equilibrium 0              0             2.5         2.5The resulting 75 mL of solution contains 
2.5 mmol of NH
4+ ions (i.e.,  0.033 M) and 
2.5 mmol (i.e.,  0.033 M ) of uneutralised NH
3 molecules. This NH3 exists in the 
following equilibrium:
NH4OH      NH4+   +     OH–
0.033M – y               y              ywhere, y  =  [OH
–]  =  [NH4+]
The final 75 mL solution after 
neutralisation already contains  
2.5 m mol NH4+ ions (i.e. 0.033M), thus 
total concentration of NH4+ ions is given 
as:
[NH4+] = 0.033 + y
As y is small, [NH4OH]  0.033 M and 
[NH4+]  0.033M.
We know,K
b = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH4OH] 
     = y (0.033)/(0.033) = 1.77 × 10–5 M
Thus, y = 1.77 × 10–5 = [OH–]
[H+] = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 = 0.56 × 10–9
Hence, pH = 9.24
6.11.9  Hydrolysis of Salts and the pH of 
their Solutions
Salts formed by the reactions between acids and bases in 
definite proportions, undergo 
ionization in water. The cations/anions

chemistry
formed on ionization of salts either exist as 
hydrated ions in aqueous solutions or interact with water to reform corresponding acids/bases depending upon the nature of salts. The later process of interaction between water and cations/anions or both of salts is called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution gets affected by this interaction. The cations (e.g., Na
+, K+, Ca2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases 
and anions (e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO3–, ClO4– etc.) of 
strong acids simply get hydrated but do not hydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of salts formed from strong acids and bases are neutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other category of salts do undergo hydrolysis.
We now consider the hydrolysis of the 
salts of the following types :
(i)
 salts of weak acid and strong base e.g., 
CH3COONa.
(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g., NH
4Cl, and
(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g., CH
3COONH4.
In the first case, CH3COONa being a salt of 
weak acid, CH3COOH and strong base, NaOH 
gets completely ionised in aqueous solution.
CH3COONa(aq)   →  CH3COO– (aq)+  Na+(aq)
Acetate ion thus formed undergoes 
hydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and 
OH– ions
CH3COO–(aq)+H2O(l) CH3COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)
Acetic acid being a weak acid  
(Ka = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in 
solution. This results in increase of OH– ion 
concentration in solution making it alkaline. The pH of such a solution is more than 7.
Similarly, NH
4Cl formed from weak 
base, NH4OH and strong acid, HCl, in water 
dissociates completely.
NH4Cl(aq) → NH+
4(aq)  +Cl– (aq)
Ammonium ions undergo hydrolysis with 
water to form NH4OH and H+ ions
NH+
4 (aq) + H2O (1)  NH4OH(aq) + H+(aq) 
Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base  
(Kb = 1.77 × 10–5) and therefore remains 
almost unionised in solution. This results in increased of H+ ion concentration in solution 
making the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of 
NH4Cl solution in water is less than 7.
Consider the hydrolysis of CH3COONH4 
salt formed from weak acid and weak base. The ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:
CH
3COO– + NH4+ +  H2O   CH3COOH +          
           
                                                    NH4OH
CH3COOH and NH4OH, also remain into 
partially dissociated form:
CH3COOH         CH3COO–  +  H+
NH4OH           NH4+    +   OH–
H2O          H+  +  OH–
Without going into detailed calculation, 
it can be said that degree of hydrolysis is 
independent of concentration of solution, and 
pH of such solutions is determined by their pK values: 
 pH = 7 + ½ (pKa – pKb)                             (6.38)
The pH of solution can be greater than 7, 
if the difference is positive and it will be less than 7, if the difference is negative.
Problem 6.25
The pK
a of acetic acid and pKb of ammonium 
hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively. 
Calculate the pH of ammonium acetate solution.
Solution
pH = 7 + ½ [p K
a – pKb]
       = 7 + ½ [4.76 – 4.75]
       = 7 + ½ [0.01]  = 7 + 0.005  = 7.005

solutions of known pH can be prepared from 
the knowledge of pKa of the acid or p Kb of base 
and by controlling the ratio of the salt and acid or salt and base. A mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate acts as buffer solution around pH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer around pH 9.25. You will learn more about 
buffer solutions in higher classes.
6.12.1
 Designing buffer Solution 
Knowledge of pKa, pKb and equilibrium 
constant help us to prepare the buffer solution 
of known pH. Let us see how we can do this.
Preparation of Acidic buffer 
To prepare a buffer of  acidic pH we 
use weak 
acid and its salt formed with strong base. 
We develop the equation relating the pH, the equilibrium constant, K
a  of weak acid and 
ratio of concentration of weak acid and its conjugate base. For 
the general case where 
the weak acid HA ionises in water, 
HA + H2O  H3O+ + A–
For which we can write the expression
Rearranging the expression we have,
Taking logarithm on both the sides and 
rearranging the terms we get —
              Or
                    (6.39)
    
(6.40) 
The expression (6.40) is known 
as 
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. The 
quantity  is the ratio of concentration 
of conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a 
weak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and concentration of [HA] is negligibly different from concentration of acid taken to form buffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A
—], 
comes from the ionisation of salt of the acid. Therefore, the concentration of conjugate base will be negligibly different from the concentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40) takes the form:
 
pp Ka H=[Salt]
[Acid]+log
In the equation (6.39), if the concentration 
of [A—] is equal to the concentration of [HA], 
then pH = pKa because value of log 1 is zero. 
Thus if we take molar concentration of acid 
and salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the buffer solution will be equal to the pK
a of the 
acid. So for preparing the buffer solution of the required pH we select that acid whose pK
a 
is close to the required pH. For acetic acid pK
a value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer 
solution formed by acetic acid and sodium acetate taken in equal molar concentration will be around 4.76.
A similar analysis of a buffer made with 
a weak base and its conjugate acid leads to 
the result,
      
pOH= p+ log[Conju gate acid ,BH+]
  [Base, B]bK   
(6.41) 
pH of the buffer solution can be calculated
 
by using the equation pH + pOH =14.
We know that pH + pOH = pKw  and  
pKa + pKb = pKw. On putting these values in 
equation (6.41) it takes the form as follows: 
p-  pH=pp[Conjuga teacid ,BH]

  [Base,B]Ka++
log
    (6.42)
If molar concentration of base and its 
conjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of 
the buffer solution will be same as pKa for the 
base. pKa value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore 
a buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained by taking ammonia solution and ammonium

(6.42) becomes:

pH of the buffer solution is not affected by 
dilution because ratio under the logarithmic 
term remains unchanged.

We have already known that the solubility of 
ionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of
 
these (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb water vapour from atmosphere. Others (such as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility that they are commonly termed as insoluble. The solubility depends on a number of factors important amongst which are the lattice enthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy of the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve in a solvent the strong forces of attraction between its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be overcome by the ion-solvent interactions. The solvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in terms of solvation which is always negative i.e. energy is released in the process of solvation. The amount of solvation enthalpy depends on the nature of the solvent. In case of a non-polar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is small and hence, not sufficient to overcome lattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the salt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As a general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve in a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy must be greater than its lattice enthalpy so that the latter may be overcome by former. Each salt has its characteristic solubility which depends on temperature. We classify salts on the basis of their solubility in the following three categories.
 Category I     Soluble    Solubility > 0.1M
 Category II    Slightly    0.01M<Solubility< 0.1M
                      Soluble 
 Category III   Sparingly  Solubility < 0.01M                      
SolubleWe shall now consider the equilibrium 
between the sparingly soluble ionic salt and 
its saturated aqueous solution.
6.13.1  Solubility Product Constant
Let us now have a solid like barium sulphate 
in contact with its 
saturated aqueous solution. 
The equilibrium between the undisolved solid and the ions in a saturated solution can be  represented by the equation:
BaSO
4(s)    Ba2+(aq) + SO42–(aq),
The equilibrium constant is given by the 
equation:
K = {[Ba2+][SO42–]} / [BaSO4]
For a pure solid substance the 
concentration remains constant and we can 
write
Ksp = K[BaSO4] = [Ba2+][SO42–]           (6.43)
We call Ksp the solubility product constant 
or simply solubility product. The experimental value of K
sp in above equation at 298K is  
1.1 × 10–10. This means that for solid barium 
sulphate in equilibrium with its saturated solution, the product of the concentrations of barium and sulphate ions is equal to its solubility product constant. The concentrations of the two ions will be equal to the molar solubility of the barium sulphate. If molar solubility is S, then 
1.1 × 10
–10 = (S)(S) = S2 
or                       S = 1.05 × 10–5.
Thus, molar solubility of barium sulphate 
will be equal to 1.05 × 10–5 mol L–1.
A salt may give on dissociation two or 
more than two anions and cations carrying 
different charges. For example, consider a salt like zirconium phosphate of molecular formula 
(Zr
4+)3(PO43–)4. It dissociates into 3 zirconium 
cations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate anions of charge –3. If the molar solubility of zirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen from the stoichiometry of the compound that
[Zr
4+] = 3S and [PO43–] = 4S 
and Ksp = (3S)3 (4S)4 = 6912 (S)7
or S = {Ksp / (33 × 44)}1/7 = (Ksp / 6912)1/7

A solid salt of the general formula MXxp

with molar solubility S in equilibrium with 
its saturated solution may be represented by the equation:
M
xXy(s)          xMp+(aq) + yXq– (aq)
(where x × p+ = y × q–)
And its solubility product constant is 
given by:
Ksp   = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y      (6.44) 
       = xx . yy . S(x + y)
     S(x + y) = Ksp / xx . yy
S = (Ksp / xx . yy)1 / x + y                                             (6.45)
The term Ksp in equation is given by Qsp 
(section 6.6.2) when the concentration of one 
or more species is not the concentration under equilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium conditions K
sp = Qsp but otherwise it gives the 
direction of the processes of precipitation or dissolution. The solubility product constants of a number of common salts at 298K are 
given in Table 6.9.table 6.9  the Solubility Product Constants, 
Ksp of Some Common ionic Salts at 
298K.
Problem 6.26
Calculate the solubility of A2X3 in pure 
water, assuming that neither kind of ion 
reacts with water. The solubility product of A
2X3, Ksp = 1.1 × 10–23.
Solution
A2X3 → 2A3+ + 3X2–
Ksp = [A3+]2 [X2–]3 = 1.1 × 10–23
If  S = solubility of A2X3, then
[A3+] = 2S;  [X2–] = 3S
therefore, Ksp = (2S)2(3S)3 = 108S5 
                                        = 1.1 × 10–23
thus, S5 = 1 × 10–25
S = 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L.

chemistry
Ksp =  [Ag+][CN–] = 6 × 10–17
Ni(OH)2      Ni2+ + 2OH–
Ksp = [Ni2+][OH–]2 = 2 × 10–15
Let [Ag+] = S1, then [CN-] = S1
Let [Ni2+] = S2, then [OH–] = 2S2
S12 = 6 × 10–17 , S1 = 7.8 × 10–9
(S2)(2S2)2 = 2 × 10–15, S2 = 0.58 × 10–4
Ni(OH)2 is more soluble than AgCN.
6.13.2  Common ion Effect on Solubility 
of ionic Salts
It i
s expected from Le Chatelier’s principle 
that if we increase the concentration of any 
one of the ions, it should combine with the ion of its opposite charge and some of the salt will be precipitated till once again K
sp = 
Qsp. Similarly, if the concentration of one of 
the ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve to increase the concentration of both the ions till once again K
sp = Qsp. This is applicable 
even to soluble salts like sodium chloride except that due to higher concentrations of the ions, we use their activities instead of their molarities in the expression for Q
sp. Thus if we take a saturated solution of 
sodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it, then sodium chloride is precipitated due to increased concentration (activity) of chloride ion available from the dissociation of HCl. Sodium chloride thus obtained is of very high purity and we can get rid of impurities like sodium and magnesium sulphates. The common ion effect is also used for almost complete precipitation of a particular ion as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low value of solubility product for gravimetric estimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion as silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide (or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as its sulphate for quantitative estimations.Dissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH)
2 provides 
S mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but 
the total concentration of OH– = (0.10 + 2S) 
mol/L because the solution already contains 
0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.
Ksp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]2 
                         = (S) (0.10 + 2S)2
As Ksp is small, 2S << 0.10, 
thus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10
Hence,2.0 × 10
–15 = S (0.10)2
S = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]
Problem 6.28
Calculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH)2 in 
0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of Ni(OH)2 
is 2.0 × 10–15.
SolutionLet the solubility of Ni(OH)
2 be equal to S. The solubility of salts of weak acids like 
phosphates increases at lower pH. This is 
because at lower pH the concentration of the anion decreases due to its protonation. This in turn increase the solubility of the salt so that K
sp = Qsp. We have to satisfy two equilibria 
simultaneously i.e.,
Ksp = [M+] [X–],
                          
 [X–] / [HX] = Ka/[H+] 
Taking inverse of both side and adding 1 
we get
HX
XH
HX H

Now, again taking inverse, we get
[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = Ka/(Ka + [H+]) and it 
can be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases. 
If S is the solubility of the salt at a given  
pH then 
Ksp = [S] [f S] = S2 {Ka/(Ka + [H+])} and
S = {Ksp ([H+] + Ka)/Ka}1/2    (6.46)
Thus solubility S increases with increase 
in [H+] or decrease in pH.

EQUILIBRIUM
SUmmArY
When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules 
returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, K
c is 
expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the stoichiometric coefficient.
For reaction, a A + b B        c C +d D
K
c = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b
Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the 
macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as K
p and is written by replacing concentration 
terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by 
reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. le Chatelier’s principle states that 
the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will 
cause the 
equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.
All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, 
bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes 
in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. 
brönsted- lowry on 
the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as 
a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. 
lewis further 
generalised the definition of an 
acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (K
a) and weak bases (Kb) are developed 
using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H
+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration 
(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka];  
pKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we 
note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and 
weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed 
briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium constant is introduced as solubility product constant  (K
sp). Its relationship with solubility 
of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.
