6.1Introduction
In Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse
trigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions.
In this chapter , we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in
engineering, science, social science, and many  other fields. For instance, we will learn
how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find
the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on
the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or
smallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals
on which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally , we use the derivative to find
approximate value of certain quantities.
6.2Rate of Change of Quantities
Recall that by the derivative ds
dt, we mean the rate of change of distance s with
respect to the time t. In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity y varies with another
quantity x, satisfying some rule ( ) y f x= , then dy
dx (or f′(x)) represents the rate of
change of y with respect to x and  dy
dxx x

=0 (or f′(x0)) represents the  rate of change
of y with respect to x at 0 x x=.
Further , if two variables x and y  are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e.,
if ( ) x f t= and ( ) y g t= , then by Chain Rule

Thus, the rate of change of y with respect to x can be calculated using the rate of
change of y and that of x both with respect to t.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 1  Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to
its radius r when r = 5 cm.
Solution  The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate
of change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by 2 A( ) 2d dr rdr dr= π = π .
When r = 5 cm, A10d
dr= π . Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of
10π cm2/s.
Example 2 The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per
second. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of an edge is 10
centimetres ?
Solution  Let x be the length of a side, V be the volume and S be the surface area of
the cube. Then, V = x3 and S = 6 x2, where 
x is a function of time t.

Example 3 A stone is dropped into a quiet lake and waves move in circles at a speed
of 4cm per second. At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is 10 cm, how
fast is the enclosed area increasing?

of change of area A with respect to time t is

Example 4 The length x of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of 3 cm/minute and
the width y is increasing at the rate of 2cm/minute. When x =10cm and y = 6cm, find

Example 5 The total cost C(x) in Rupees, associated with the production of x units of
an item is given by
C(x) = 0.005 x3 – 0.02 x2 + 30 x + 5000
Find the marginal cost when 3 units are produced, where by marginal cost we
mean the instantaneous rate of change of total cost at any level of output.
Solution  Since marginal cost is the rate of change of total cost with respect to the
output, we have
Marginal cost (MC) =20.005(3 ) 0.02(2 ) 30dCx xdx= − +
When x = 3, MC =20.015(3 ) 0.04(3) 30− +

Hence, the required marginal cost is ` 30.02 (nearly).

number of items sold at an instant.
Solution
 Since marginal revenue is the rate of change of total revenue with respect to
the number of units sold, we have
Marginal Revenue (MR) =R6 36dxdx= +
When x =5, MR = 6(5) + 36 = 66
Hence, the required marginal revenue is ` 66.

6.3  Increasing and Decreasing Functions
In this section, we will use differentiation to find out whether a function is increasing or
decreasing or none.
Consider the function f given by f(x) = x2, x Î R. The graph of this function is a
parabola  as given in Fig 6.1.
Fig 6.1
First consider the graph (Fig 6.1) to the right of the origin. Observe that as we
move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases.
For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers x > 0.
Now consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move
from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases.
Consequently , the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers  x < 0.
We shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is
increasing or decreasing on an interval.
Definition 1  Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f.
Then f is said to be
(i)increasing on I if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) < f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I.
(ii) decreasing on I, if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) > f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I.
(iii) constant on I, if f(x) = c for all x Î I, where c is a constant.x f (x) = x2

(iv) strictly increasing on I if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) < f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I.
(v) strictly decreasing on I if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) > f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I.
For graphical representation of such functions see Fig 6.2.
Fig 6.2
We shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point.
Definition 2  Let x0 be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function  f.
Then  f  is said to be increasing, decreasing at x0 if  there exists an open interval I
containing x0 such that f is increasing, decreasing, respectively , in I.
Let us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function.
Example 7  Show that the function given by f(x) = 7 x – 3 is increasing on R.
Solution
 Let x1 and x2 be any two numbers in R. Then
x1 < x2 Þ 7x1 < 7x2  Þ 7x1 – 3 < 7 x2 – 3 Þ f(x1) < f(x2)
Thus, by Definition 1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R.
We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions.
The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5.
Theorem 1  Let  f  be continuous on [ a, b] and differentiable on the open interval
(a,b). Then
(a) f  is increasing in [ a,b] if f¢(x) > 0 for each x Î (a, b)
(b) f  is decreasing in [ a,b] if f¢(x) < 0 for each x Î (a, b)
(c) f  is a constant function in [ a,b] if f¢(x) = 0 for each x Î (a, b)Strictly Incr easing function

Proof (a) Let x1, x2 Î [a, b] be such that x1 < x2.
Then, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point c
between x1 and x2 such that
f(x2) –f(x1) = f¢(c) (x2 – x1)
i.e. f(x2) –f(x1) > 0 (as f¢(c) > 0 (given))
i.e. f(x2) >f(x1)
Thus, we have
1 2 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ), for all , [ , ] x x f x f x x x a b   
Hence, f  is an increasing function in [ a,b].
The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar . It is left as an exercise to the reader .
Remarks
There is a more generalised theorem, which states that if f¢(x) > 0 for x in an interval
excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is increasing. Similarly ,
if f¢(x) < 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the
interval, then f is decreasing.
Example 8 Show that the function  f  given by
f(x) =x3 – 3x2 + 4x, x Î R
is increasing on R.
Solution Note that
f¢(x) =3x2 – 6x + 4
=3(x2 – 2x + 1) + 1
=3(x – 1)2 + 1 > 0, in every interval of R
Therefore, the function  f is increasing on R.
Example 9  Prove that the function given by f(x) = cos x is
(a) decreasing in (0, p)
(b) increasing in ( p, 2p), and
(c) neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2 p).

Fig 6.4Solution Note that f′(x) = – sin x
(a) Since for each x ∈ (0, π), sin x > 0, we have f′(x) < 0 and so f is decreasing in
(0, π).
(b) Since for each x ∈ (π, 2π), sin x < 0, we have f′(x) > 0 and so f is increasing in
(π, 2π).
(c) Clearly by (a) and (b) above, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2 π).
Example 10  Find the intervals in which the function f given by f(x) = x2 – 4x + 6 is
(a)increasing (b)  decreasing
Solution
 We have
f(x)=x2 – 4x + 6
or f′(x)=2x – 4
Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 2. Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two
disjoint intervals namely , (– ∞, 2) and (2, ∞) (Fig 6.3). In the interval (– ∞, 2), f′(x) = 2x
– 4 < 0.
Therefore, f is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval (2, )∞, ( ) 0f x>′
and so the function  f  is increasing in this interval.
Example 1 1 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72 x
+ 30 is (a) increasing (b) decreasing.
Solution
 We have
f(x)=4x3 – 6x2 – 72 x + 30
or f′(x)=12x2 – 12 x – 72
=12(x2 – x – 6)
=12(x – 3) ( x + 2)
Therefore, f′(x) = 0 gives x  = – 2, 3. The
points x  = – 2 and  x = 3 divides the real line into
three disjoint intervals, namely , (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 3)
and (3, ∞).Fig 6.3

In the intervals (– ∞, – 2) and (3, ∞ ), f′(x) is positive while in the interval (– 2, 3),
f′(x) is negative. Consequently , the function f is increasing in the intervals
(–

f is neither increasing nor decreasing in R.

6.4  Maxima and Minima
In this section, we will use the concept of derivatives to calculate the maximum or
minimum values of  various functions. In fact, we will find the ‘turning points’ of the
graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or
Reprint 2025-26
 MA THEMA TICS 160
lowest) locally . The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of
a given function. Further , we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum
of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems.
Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life.
(i)The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by P( x) = ax + bx2, where a,b
are constants and x is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per
acre will maximise the profit?
(ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building 60 metres high, travels along a path
given by 2
( ) 6060xh x x= + − , where x is the horizontal distance from the building
and h(x) is the height of the ball . What is the maximum height the ball will
reach?
(iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve
f (x) = x2 + 7. A soldier , placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter
when it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance?
In each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out
the maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems,
we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local
maxima and minima and test for determining such points.
Definition 3  Let f be a function defined on an interval I. Then
(a)  f is said to have a maximum value  in I, if there exists a point c in I such that
( ) ( )> f c f x , for all x  ∈ I.
The number f(c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a
point of maximum value  of f in I.
(b)  f  is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that
f(c) < f(x), for all x ∈ I.
The number f(c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point
c, in this case, is called a point of minimum value  of  f  in I.
(c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that
f (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f  in I.
The number  f(c), in this case, is called an extreme value  of  f  in I and the point c
is called an extreme point .
Remark  In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular
functions  help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through
graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it
is not even differentiable (Example 15).

Solution  From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.8), we
have  f(x) = 0 if x = 0. Also
f(x) ≥0, for all x ∈ R.
Therefore, the minimum value of  f  is 0 and the point of
minimum value of f is x = 0. Further , it may be observed
from the graph of the function that f  has no maximum value
and hence no point of maximum value of  f  in R.
ANote  If we restrict the domain of  f to [– 2, 1] only ,
then f will have maximum value(– 2)2 = 4 at x = – 2.
Example 15  Find the maximum and minimum values
of  f , if any , of the function given by f(x) = 
|x|, x ∈ R.
Solution  From the graph of the given function
(Fig 6.9) , note that
f(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and  f(x) = 0  if  x = 0.
Therefore, the function f has a minimum value 0
and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0. Also, the
graph clearly shows that f has no maximum value in R
and hence no point of maximum value in R.

Fig 6.10(ii) One may note that the function f in Example 27 is not differentiable at
x = 0.
Example 16  Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any , of the function
given by
f(x) =x, x ∈ (0, 1).
Solution  The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval
(0, 1). From the graph (Fig 6.10) of the function f , it
seems that, it should have the minimum value at a
point closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value
at a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points
available? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate
such points. Infact, if a point x0 is closest to 0, then
we find 0
02xx< for all 0(0,1)x∈ . Also, if x1 is closest
to 1, then 1
11
2xx+> for all 1(0,1)x∈ .
Therefore, the given function has neither the
maximum value nor the minimum value in the interval (0,1).
Remark  The reader may observe that in Example 16, if we include the points 0 and 1
in the domain of  f , i.e., if we extend the domain of  f  to [0,1], then the function  f  has
minimum value 0 at x = 0 and maximum value 1 at x = 1. Infact, we have the following
results (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text)
Every monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end
points of the domain of definition of the function.
A more general result is
Every continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum
value.
ANote   By a monotonic function f  in an interval I, we mean that f  is either
increasing in I or decreasing in I.
Maximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be
discussed later in this section.
Let us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.1 1. Observe that at
points A, B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to
increasing or vice-versa. These points may be called turning points  of the given
function. Further , observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little
valley . Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood
(interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective
Reprint 2025-26
APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 163
valleys. Similarly , the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B
and D which are at the top of their respective hills. For this reason, the points A and C
may be regarded as points of local minimum value  (or r elative minimum value ) and
points B and D may be regarded as points of local maximum value  (or relative maximum
value ) for the function. The local maximum value  and local minimum value  of the
function are referred to as local maxima  and local minima , respectively , of the function.
We now formally give the following definition
Definition 4  Let  f  be a real valued function and let c be an interior point in the domain
of f. Then
(a) c is called a point of local maxima  if there is an h > 0 such that
f(c) ≥ f(x), for all 
x in (c – h, c + h), x ≠ c
The value f(c) is called the local maximum value  of f.
(b) c is called a point of local minima  if there is an h > 0 such that
f(c) ≤ f(x), for all  x  in (c – h, c + h)
The value f(c) is called the local minimum value  of f .
Geometrically , the above definition states that if  x = c is a point of local maxima of  f,
then the graph of f around c will be as shown in Fig 6.12(a). Note that the function f  is
increasing (i.e., f′(x) > 0) in the interval ( c – h, c) and decreasing (i.e., f′(x) < 0) in the
interval ( c, c + h).
This suggests that f′(c) must be zero.Fig 6.1 1
Fig 6.12
Reprint 2025-26
 MA THEMA TICS 164
Fig 6.13Similarly , if c is a point of local minima of f , then the graph of f around c will be as
shown in Fig 6.14(b). Here f  is decreasing (i.e., f′(x) < 0) in the interval ( c – h, c) and
increasing (i.e., f′(x) > 0) in the interval ( c, c + h). This again suggest that f′(c) must
be zero.
The above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof).
Theorem 2  Let  f  be a function defined on an open interval I. Suppose c ∈ I be  any
point. If f  has a local maxima or a local minima at x = c, then either f′(c) = 0 or f  is not
differentiable at c.
Remark  The converse of above theorem need not
be true, that is, a point at which the derivative vanishes
need not be a point of local maxima or local minima.
For example, if f(x) = x3, then f′(x) = 3 x2 and so
f′(0) = 0. But 0 is neither a point of local maxima nor
a point of local minima (Fig 6.13).
ANote    A point c in the domain of a function f at
which either f′(c) = 0 or f is not differentiable is
called a critical point  of f. Note that if f is continuous
at c and f′(c) = 0, then there exists an h > 0 such
that f is differentiable in the interval
(c – 
h, c + h).
We shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of
local minima using only the first order derivatives.
Theor em 3 (First Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an open interval I.
Let f be continuous at a critical point c in I. Then
(i)If f′(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x increases through c, i.e., if
f′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f′(x) < 0 at
every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local
maxima .
(ii) If f′(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through c, i.e., if
f′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f′(x) > 0 at
every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local
minima .
(iii) If f′(x) does not change sign as x increases through c, then c  is neither a point of
local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called point of
inflection  (Fig 6.13).
Reprint 2025-26

ANote   If c is a point of local maxima of f , then f(c) is a local maximum value of
f. Similarly , if c is a point of local minima of f , then  f(c) is a local minimum value of f.
Figures 6.13 and 6.14, geometrically explain Theorem 3.
Fig 6.14
Example 17  Find all points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by
f(x) =x3 – 3x + 3.
Solution  We have
f(x) =x3 – 3x + 3
or f′(x) =3x2 – 3 = 3(x – 1) (
x + 1)
or f′(x) =0 at x = 1 and x = – 1
Thus, x = ± 1 are the only critical points which could possibly be the points of local
maxima and/or local minima of f . Let us first examine the point x = 1.
Note that for values close to 1 and to the right of 1, f′(x) > 0 and  for values close
to 1 and to the left of 1, f′(x) < 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x  = 1 is a point
of local minima and local minimum value is f(1) = 1. In the case of x = –1, note that
f′(x) > 0, for values close to and to the left of –1 and f′(x) < 0, for values close to and
to the right of – 1. Therefore, by first derivative test, x = – 1 is a point of local maxima
and local maximum value is  f(–1) = 5.

given by
f(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5.
Solution We have
f(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x + 5
or f′(x) =6x2 – 12 x + 6 = 6(x – 1)2
or f′(x) =0    at   x = 1
Thus, x = 1 is the only critical point of  f . We shall now examine this point for local
maxima and/or local minima of f. Observe that f′(x) ≥ 0, for all 
x ∈ R and in particular
f′(x) > 0, for values close to 1 and to the left and to the right of 1. Therefore, by first
derivative test, the point x = 1 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local
minima. Hence x = 1 is a point of inflexion.
Remark One may note that since f′(x), in Example 30, never changes its sign on R,
graph of f  has no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima.
We shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a
given function. This test is often easie r to apply than the first derivative test.
Theor em 4 (Second Derivative Test) Let  f  be a function defined on an interval  I
and c  ∈ I. Let f  be twice differentiable at c. Then
(i)x = c is a point of local maxima if f′(c) = 0 and f″(c) < 0
The value f (c) is local maximum value of  f .
(ii) x = c is a point of local minima if ( ) 0f c=′  and f″(c) > 0
In this case, f (c) is local minimum value of  f .
(iii) The test fails if f′(c) = 0 and f″(c) = 0.
In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether  c is a point of
local maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion.
ANote   As f is twice dif ferentiable at c, we mean
second order derivative of f exists at c.
Example 19 Find local minimum value of the function f
given by  f (x) = 3 + |x|, x ∈ R.
Solution  Note that the given function is not differentiable
at x  = 0. So, second derivative test fails. Let us try first
derivative test. Note that 0 is a critical point of f . Now to
the left of 0, f(x) = 3 – x and so f′(x) = – 1 < 0. Also to
Reprint 2025-26
APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 167
the right of 0, f(x) = 3 + x and so  f′(x) = 1 > 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x =
0 is a point of  local minima of  f  and local minimum value of  f  is f (0) = 3.
Example 20  Find local maximum and local minimum values of the function  f  given by
f (x) =3x4 + 4x3 – 12 x2 + 12
Solution  We have
f (x) =3x4 + 4x3 – 12 x2 + 12
or f′(x) =12x3 + 12 x2 – 24 x = 12 x (x – 1) ( x + 2)
or f′(x) =0 at x = 0, x = 1 and x = – 2.

minima and local minimum values of f at x = – 1 and – 2 are f (1) = 7 and f (–2) = –20,
respectively .

a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion.

Example 24 Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at
points A and B, respectively . If AP = 16 m, BQ  = 22 m
and AB = 20 m, then find the distance of a point R on
AB from the point A such that RP2 + RQ2 is minimum.
Solution Let R be a point on AB such that AR = x m.
Then RB = (20 – x) m (as AB = 20 m). From Fig 6.16,
we have
RP2 =AR2 + AP2
and RQ2 =RB2 + BQ2
Therefore RP2 + RQ2 =AR2 + AP2 + RB2 + BQ2
=x2 + (16)2 + (20 – x)2 + (22)2

Let S ≡ S(x) =RP2 + RQ2 = 2x2 – 40 x + 1140.
Therefore S′(x) =4x – 40.
Now S′(x) = 0 gives x = 10. Also S
″(x) = 4 > 0, for all x and so S″ (10) > 0.
Therefore, by second derivative test, x = 10 is the point of local minima of S. Thus, the
distance of R from A on AB is AR = x =10 m.

6.4.1  Maximum and Minimum V alues of a Function in a Closed Interval
Let us consider a function  f  given by
f(x) =x + 2, x ∈ (0, 1)
Observe that the function is continuous on (0, 1) and neither has a maximum value
nor has a minimum value. Further , we may note that the function even has neither a
local maximum value nor a local minimum value.
However , if we extend the domain of  f  to the closed interval [0, 1], then f still may
not have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value
3 = f(1) and minimum value 2 =  f(0). The maximum value 3 of f at x = 1 is called
absolute maximum  value ( global maximum  or greatest value ) of f on the interval
[0, 1]. Similarly , the minimum value 2 of f  at x  = 0 is called the absolute minimum
value (
global minimum  or least value ) of f on [0, 1].
Consider the graph given in Fig 6.19 of a continuous function defined on a closed
interval [ a, d]. Observe that the function f has a local minima at x = b and localFig 6.18
Reprint 2025-26
 MA THEMA TICS 172
minimum value is f(b). The function also has a local maxima at x = c and local maximum
value is f (c).
Also from the graph, it is evident that f has  absolute maximum value f(a) and
absolute minimum value f(d). Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum)
value of f  is different from local maximum (minimum) value of f.
We will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and
absolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I.
Theorem 5  Let f  be a continuous function on an interval I = [ a, b]. Then f has the
absolute maximum value and f attains it at least once in I. Also, f has the absolute
minimum value and attains it at least once in I.
Theorem 6 Let f be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let c be any
interior point of I. Then
(i)f′(c) = 0 if  f attains its absolute maximum value at c.
(ii)f′(c) = 0 if  f attains its absolute minimum value at c.
In view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute
maximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval
[a, b].
Working Rule
Step 1:Find all critical points of  f  in the interval, i.e., find points x where either
( ) 0f x=′  or f  is not differentiable.
Step 2: Take the end points of the interval.
Step 3:At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of  f .
Step 4:Identify the maximum and minimum values of  f  out of the values calculated in
Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum (greatest) value of
f  and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum (least) value of  f .Fig 6.19

Example 27  Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a function f given by
f(x) =2x3 – 15 x2 + 36 x +1 on the interval [1, 5].
Solution  We have
f(x) =2x3 – 15 x2 + 36 x + 1
or f′(x) =6x2 – 30 x + 36 = 6(x – 3) (
x – 2)
Note that f′(x) = 0 gives  x = 2 and x = 3.
We shall now evaluate the value of f at these points and at the end points of the
interval [1, 5], i.e., at x = 1, x = 2, x  = 3 and at x = 5. So
f(1) = 2(13) – 15 (12) + 3 6(1) + 1 = 24
f(2) = 2(23) – 15 (22) + 3 6(2) + 1 = 29
f(3) = 2(33) – 15 (32) + 3 6(3) + 1 = 28
f(5) = 2(53) – 15 (52) + 3 6(5) + 1 = 56
Thus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of  f on [1, 5] is 56, occurring at
x =5, and absolute  minimum value of f on [1, 5] is 24 which occurs at x = 1.

Let f(x) =(x – 3)2 + x4
or f′(x) =2(x – 3) + 4x3 = 2(x – 1) (2 x2 + 2x + 3)
Thus, f′(x) = 0 gives 
x = 1 or 2 x2 + 2x + 3 = 0 for which there are  no real roots.
Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which f′ is zero,
i.e., there is only one point, namely , x = 1. The value of f at this point is given by
f (1) = (1 – 3)2 + (1)4  = 5. Thus, the distance between the solider and the helicopter is
(1) 5f= .
Note that 5 is either a maximum value or a minimum value. Since
(0)f  =2 4(0 3) (0) 3 5− + = > ,
it follows that 5 is the minimum value of  ( )f x . Hence, 5 is the minimum

Now f′(x) = 0 gives x = 1, x = – 2, or x = 3. The
points x = 1, – 2, and 3 divide the real line into four
disjoint intervals namely , (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 1), (1, 3)
and (3, ∞) (Fig 6.22).
Consider the interval (– ∞, – 2), i.e., when – ∞ < x < – 2.
In this case, we have  x – 1 < 0, x + 2 < 0 and x – 3 < 0.
(In particular , observe that for x = –3, f′(x) = (x – 1) ( x + 2) ( x – 3) = (– 4) (– 1)
(– 6) < 0)
Therefore, f′(x) < 0 when – 
∞ < x < – 2.
Thus, the function f is decreasing in (– ∞, – 2).
Consider the interval (– 2, 1), i.e., when  – 2 < x < 1.
In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x  + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0
(In particular , observe that for x = 0, f′(x) = (x – 1) ( x + 2) ( x – 3) = (–1) (2) (–3)
= 6 > 0)
So f′(x) > 0 when – 2 < x < 1.
Thus, f is increasing in (– 2, 1).
Now consider the interval (1,  3), i.e., when 1 < x < 3. In this case, we have
x – 1 > 0,  x  + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0.
So, f′(x) < 0 when 1 < x < 3.
Thus,  f is decreasing in (1, 3).
Finally , consider the interval (3, ∞), i.e., when  x > 3. In this case, we have x – 1 > 0,
x + 2 > 0 and  x – 3 > 0. So f′(x) > 0 when x > 3.
Thus,  f  is increasing in the interval (3, ∞).

Step 2 :Take the end points of the interval.
Step 3 : At all these points (listed in S tep 1 and 2), calculate the values of  f .
Step 4 : Identify the maximum and minimum values of f out of the values
calculated in  Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum
value of  f  and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum value of  f .
