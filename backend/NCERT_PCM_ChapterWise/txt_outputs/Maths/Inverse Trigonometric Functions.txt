vMathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of
self-evident things. — FELIX KLEIN v
2.1  Introduction
In Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function
f, denoted by f–1, exists if f is one-one and onto. There are
many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and
hence we can not talk of their inverses. In Class XI, we
studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and
onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their
inverses do not exist. In this chapter , we shall study about
the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric
functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and
observe their behaviour through graphical representations.
Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed.
The inverse trigonometric functions play an important
role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals.
The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering.
2.2  Basic Concepts
In Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows:
sine function, i.e., sine : R → [– 1, 1]
cosine function, i.e., cos : R → [– 1, 1]
tangent function, i.e., tan : R – { x : x = (2 n 
+ 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} → R
cotangent function, i.e., cot : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R
secant function, i.e., sec : R – { x : x = (2 n + 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)
cosecant function, i.e., cosec : R – { x : x = nπ,  n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)Chapter 2

We have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : X→Y such that f(x) = y is one-one and
onto, then we can define a unique function g : Y→X such that g(y) = x, where x ∈ X
and y = f(x), y ∈ 
Y. Here, the domain of g = range of f and the range of g =  domain
of f. The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f–1. Further , g is also
one-one and onto and inverse of g is f. Thus, g–1 = (f –1)–1 = f. We also have
(f –1 o f ) ( x) = f –1 (f (x)) = f –1(y) = x
and (f o f –1) (y) = f (f –1(y))  = f(x) = y
Since the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the
closed interval [–1, 1]. If we restrict its domain to ,2 2−π π 

and onto with range [– 1, 1]. Actually , sine function restricted to any of the intervals

  etc., is one-one and its range is [–1, 1]. We can,
therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals. We denote the
inverse of sine function by sin–1 (arc sine function). Thus, sin–1 is a function whose
domain is [– 1, 1] and range could be any of the intervals 3,2 2− π −π 
  , ,2 2−π π 
   or
3,2 2π π 
  , and so on. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch  of the
function sin–1. The branch with range ,2 2−π π 
   is called the principal value branch,
wher eas other inter vals as range give differ ent branches of sin–1. When we refer
to the function sin–1, we take it as the function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range is
,2 2−π π 
  . We write  sin–1 : [–1, 1] → ,2 2−π π 
  
From the definition of the inverse functions, it follows that sin (sin–1 x) = x
if  – 1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and sin–1 (sin x) = x if 2 2xπ π− ≤ ≤ . In other words, if y = sin–1 x, then
sin y = x.
Remarks
(i)We know from Chapter 1, that if y = f(x) is an invertible function, then  x = f –1 (y).
Thus, the graph of sin–1 function can be obtained from the graph of original
function  by interchanging x and y axes, i.e., if ( a, b) is a point on the graph  of
sine function, then ( b, a) becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse

of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function y = sin–1 x can be obtained from
the graph of y = sin x  by interchanging x and y axes. The graphs of y = sin x and
y = sin–1 x are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (ii), (iii). The dark portion of the graph of
y = sin–1 x represent the principal value branch.
(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the
corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along
the line y = x. This can be visualised by looking the graphs of y = sin x and
y = sin–1 x as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii)).
Like sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of all
real numbers and range is the set [–1, 1]. If we restrict the domain of cosine function
to [0, π], then it becomes one-one and onto with range [–1, 1]. Actually ,  cosine functionFig 2.1 (ii) Fig 2.1 (iii)Fig 2.1 (i)

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS      21
restricted to an y of the intervals [– π, 0],  [0,π], [π, 2π] etc., is bijective with range as
[–1, 1]. We can, therefore, define the inverse of cosine function in each of these
intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by cos–1 (arc cosine function).
Thus, cos–1 is a function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range
could be any of the intervals [– π, 0], [0, π], [π , 2π] etc.
Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the
function cos–1. The  branch with range [0, π] is called the principal
value branch of the function cos–1. We write
cos–1 : [–1, 1] → [0, π].
The graph of  the function given by  y = cos–1 x can be drawn
in the same way as discussed about the graph of y = sin–1 x. The
graphs of y = cos x and y = cos–1x are given in Fig  
2.2 (i) and  (ii).
Fig 2.2 (ii)
Let us now discuss cosec–1x and sec–1x as follows:
Since, cosec x = 1
sinx, the domain of the cosec function is the set {x : x ∈ R and
x ≠ nπ, n
 ∈ Z} and the range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y ≥ 1 or y ≤ –1} i.e., the set
R – (–1, 1). It means that y = cosec x assumes all real values except –1 < y < 1 and is
not defined for integral multiple of π. If we restrict the domain of cosec function to
,2 2π π −  – {0}, then it is one to one and onto with its range as the set R – (– 1, 1). Actually ,

The graphs of y = cosec x and y = cosec–1 x are given in Fig 2.3 (i), (ii).
Also, since sec x = 1
cosx, the domain of y = sec x is the set R – {x : x = (2n + 1) 2π,
n ∈ Z} and range is the set R – (–1, 1). It means that sec (secant function) assumes
all real values except –1 < y < 1 and is not defined for odd multiples of 2π. If we
restrict the domain of  secant function to [0, π] – { 2π}, then it is one-one and onto withFig 2.3 (i) Fig 2.3 (ii)

range could be any of the intervals [– π, 0] – {2−π}, [0, π] – {2π}, [π, 2π] – {3
2π} etc.
Corresponding to each of t hese intervals , we get  different branches of the function sec–1.
The branch with range [0, π] – {2π} is called the principal value branch of the
function sec–1. We thus have
sec–1 : R – (–1,1) →  [0, π] – {2π}
The graphs of the functions y = sec x  and y = sec-1 x are given in Fig 2.4 (i), (ii).
Finally , we now discuss tan–1 and cot–1
We know that the domain of the tan function (tangent function) is the set
{x : x ∈ R and x ≠ (2
n +1) 2π, n ∈ Z} and the range is R. It means that tan function
is not defined for odd multiples of  2π. If we restrict the domain of tangent function toFig 2.4 (i) Fig 2.4 (ii)

The graphs of the function  y = tan x and y = tan–1x are given in Fig 2.5 (i), (ii).
Fig 2.5 (i) Fig  2.5 (ii)
We know that domain of the cot function (cotangent function) is the set
{x : x ∈ R and x ≠ nπ, n ∈ Z} and range is R. It means that cotangent function is not
defined for integral multiples of π. If we restrict the domain of cotangent function to
(0, π), then it is bijective with and its range as R. In fact, cotangent function restricted
to any of the intervals (– π, 0), (0, π), (π, 2π) etc., is bijective and its range is R. Thus
cot–1 can be defined as a function whose domain is the R and range as any of the

intervals (– π, 0), (0, π ), (π, 2π) etc. These intervals give different branches of the
function co t–1. The function with range (0, π) is called the principal value branch  of
the function co t–1. We thus have

2.3  Pr oper ties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
In this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric
functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal
value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever
they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse
trigonometric functions. In fact, they will be valid only for some values of x for which
inverse trigonometric functions are defined. We will not go into the details of these
values of x in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook.
Let us recall that if y = sin–1x, then x = sin y and if x = sin y, then y = sin–1x. This
is equivalent to
sin (sin–1 x) = x, x ∈  [– 1, 1] and sin–1 (sin x) = x, x ∈ ,2 2−π π 

Historical Note
The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I
(600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1 114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry . All
this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The
Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so
clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted
throughout the world.
In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of
the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to
mathematics.
Bhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90 °. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for sines or
cosines of 18 °, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., were given by Bhaskara II.
The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were suggested
by the astronomer Sir John F .W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:
