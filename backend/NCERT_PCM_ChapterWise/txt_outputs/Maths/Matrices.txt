3.1  Introduction
The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices
are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies
our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The
evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and
simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a
representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices
far exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet
programs for personal computer , which in turn is used in dif ferent areas of business
and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an
experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and
reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices
are also used in cryptography . This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches
of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology , modern psychology and industrial
management.
In this chapter , we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the
fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra.

Suppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may
express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of
notebooks that Radha has. Now , if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks
and 6 pens. We may express it as [15  6] with the understanding that first number
inside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed
by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possessionChapter 3

of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which
is as follows:
Radha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens,
Fauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens,
Simran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens.
Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows:
Notebooks Pens
Radha 15 6
Fauzia 10 2
Simran 13 5
and this can be expressed as
or
Radha Fauzia Simran
Notebooks 15 10 13
Pens 6 2 5
which can be expressed as:
In the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of
note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the
second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran,

respectively . Similarly , in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent
the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively . The
entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia
and Simran, respectively . An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a
matrix . Formally , we define matrix as:
Definition 1   A matrix  is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The
numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.
We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:
5 – 2
A 0 5
3 6 
 = 
  , 12 32
B 3.5 –1 2

 = 
 
  ,  31 3Ccos tan sin 2x x
x x x  += +  
In the ab ove examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows
of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns  of the
matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2
rows and 3 columns.
3.2.1   Order of a matrix
A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n
matrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we
have A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix.  We observe that A has
3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively .
In general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array:
orA = [ aij]m × n, 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n   i, j ∈ N
Thus the ith  row consists of the elements ai1, ai2, ai3,..., ain, while the jth column
consists of the elements a1j, a2j, a3j,..., amj,
In general aij, is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call
it as the ( i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be
equal to mn.

MATRI CES         37
ANote   In this chapter
1.We shall follow the notation, namely A = [aij]m × n to indicate that A is a matrix
of order m × n.
2.We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or
functions taking real values.
We can also represent any point ( x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as
x
y 
   (or [ x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as
0P1 =   or [0 1].
Observe that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear
figure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices
A (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2).
Now , quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as
2 4A B C D
1 3 1 1X0 2 3 2×−  =  or
4 2A 1 0
B 3 2YC 1 3
D 1 2× 
 
 = 
 − 
Thus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in
a plane.
Now , let us consider some examples.
Example 1  Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women
workers in three factories I, II and III
Men workers Women workers
I 30 25
II 25 31
III 27 26
Represent the above information in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix. What does the entry
in the third row and second column represent?

A 25 31

 = 
  
The ent ry in the third row and second column represents the number of women
workers in factory III.
Example 2  If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?
Solution We know that if a matrix is of order m × n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find
all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural
numbers, whose product is 8.
Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)
Hence, possible orders are 1 × 8, 8 ×1, 4 × 2, 2 × 4
Example 3
 Construct a 3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by 1| 3 |2ija i j= − .

3.3  Types of Matrices
 In this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices.
(i)Column matrix
A matrix is said to be a column matrix  if it has only one column.
For example,  0
3
A 1
1/ 2 
 
 
 = − 
   is a column matrix of order 4 × 1.
In general, A = [aij]m × 1 is a column matrix of order m × 1.
(ii) Row matrix
A matrix is said to be a row matrix  if it has only one row .
For example, 
1 41B 5 2 32 × = −   is a row matrix.
In general, B = [ bij]1 × n is a row matrix of order 1 × n.
(iii) Square matrix
A matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is
said to be a squar e matrix . Thus an m × n matrix is said to be a square matrix if
m = n and is known as a square matrix of order ‘ n’.
For example 3 1 0
3A 3 2 12
4 3 1−  
 
  = 
 −   is a square matrix of order 3.
In general, A = [aij]m × m is a square matrix of order m.
ANote  If A = [ aij] is a square matrix of order n, then elements (entries) a11, a22, ..., ann
are said to constitute the diagonal , of the matrix A. Thus, if 1 3 1
A 2 4 1
3 5 6− 
 = − 
  .
Then the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6.
Reprint 2025-26
 40 MATHEMA TICS
(iv) Diagonal matrix
A square matrix B = [ bij]m × m is said to be a diagonal matrix  if all its non
diagonal elements are zero, that is a matrix B = [ bij]m × m is said to be a diagonal
matrix if bij = 0, when i ≠ j.
For example,  A = [4], 1 0B0 2− =  , 1.1 0 0
C 0 2 0
0 0 3− 
 = 
  , are diagonal matrices
of order 1, 2, 3, respectively .
(v) Scalar matrix
A diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if its diagonal elements are equal,
that is, a square matrix B = [ bij]n × n is said to be a scalar matrix if
bij = 0,    when i  ≠ j
bij = k,   when i  = j, for some constant k.
For example
A = [3],     1 0B0 1− = −  ,      3 0 0
C 0 3 0
0 0 3 
 
= 
 
 
are scalar matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively .
(vi) Identity matrix
A square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero
is called an identity matrix . In other words, the square matrix A = [ aij]n × n is an
identity matrix, if 1 if
0 ifiji jai j= =≠ .
We denote the identity matrix of order n by In. When order is clear from the
context, we simply write it as I.
For example [1], 1 0
0 1 
  , 1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1 
 
 
   are identity matrices of order 1, 2 and 3,
respectively .
Observe that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when k = 1. But every identity
matrix is clearly a scalar matrix.
Reprint 2025-26
MATRI CES         41
(vii) Zero matrix
A matrix is said to be zero matrix  or null matrix  if all its elements are zero.
For example, [0], 0 0
0 0 
  , 0 0 0
0 0 0 
  , [0, 0] are all zero matrices. We denote
zero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context.
3.3.1  Equality of matrices
Definition 2 Two matrices A = [aij] and B = [ bij] are said to be equal if
(i)they are of the same order
(ii) each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, that is aij = bij for
all i and j.
For example, 2 3 2 3and0 1 0 1   
       are equal matrices but 3 2 2 3and0 1 0 1   
       are
not equal matrices. Symbolically , if two matrices A and B are equal, we write A = B.

Find the values of a, b, c, x, y and z.
Solution As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements
must be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get
x + 3= 0, z + 4 = 6, 2y – 7= 3y – 2
a – 1 = – 3, 0 =2c + 2 b – 3 = 2b + 4,
Simplifying, we get
a = – 2,
 b = – 7, c = – 1, x = – 3, y = –5, z  = 2

2a + b =4 5c – d =11
a – 2b =– 3 4c + 3d =24

In this section, we shall introduce certain operations on matrices, namely , addition of
matrices, multiplication of a matrix by a scalar , difference and multiplication of matrices.
3.4.1  Addition of matrices

shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The
quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below:

In category 1 : for boys (80 + 90), for girls (60 + 50)
In category 2 : for boys (75 + 70), for girls (65 + 55)

This new matrix is the sum of the above two matrices. We observe that the sum of
two matrices is a matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the given
matrices. Furthermore, the two matrices have to be of the same order .
Thus, if  11 12 13

In general, if A = [aij] and B = [ bij] are two matrices of the same order , say m × n.
Then, the sum of the two matrices A and B is defined  as a matrix C = [ cij]m × n, where
cij = aij + bij, for all possible values of i and j.

2 3 0  −= 
  and 2 5 1
B 12 32 
 = −  , find A + B
Since A, B are of the same order 2 × 3. Therefore, addition of A and B is defined
and is given by

ANote
1.We emphasise that if A and B are not of the same order , then A + B is not
defined. For example if 2 3A1 0 =  , 1 2 3B ,1 0 1 =   then A + B is not defined.
2.We may observe that addition of matrices is an example of binary operation
on the set of matrices of the same order .

In general, we may define multiplication of a matrix  by a scalar as follows: if
A = [aij]m × n is a matrix and k is a scalar , then kA is another matrix which is obtained
by multiplying each element of A by the scalar k.
In other words, kA = k[aij]m × n = [k (aij)]m × n, that is, ( i, j)th element of kA is kaij
for all possible values of i and j.

Difference of matrices   If A = [aij], B = [ bij] are two matrices of the same order ,
say m × n, then dif ference A – B is defined as a matrix D = [ dij], where 
dij = aij – bij,
for all value of i and j. In other words, D = A – B = A + (–1) B, that is sum of the matrix
A and the matrix – B.

3.4.3   Properties of matrix addition
The addition of matrices satisfy the following properties:
(i)Commutative Law   If A = [aij], B = [ bij] are matrices of the same order , say
m × n, then A + B = B + A.
Now A + B = [aij] + [ bij] = [ aij + bij]
=[bij + aij] (addition of numbers is commutative)
=([bij] + [aij]) = B + A
(ii) Associative Law  For any three matrices A = [aij], B = [ bij], C = [ cij] of the
same order , say m × n, (A + B) + C = A + (B + C).
Now (A + B) + C = ([aij] + [ bij]) + [ cij]
=[aij + bij] + [ cij] = [( aij + bij) + cij]
=[aij + (bij + cij)] (Why?)
=[aij] + [( bij + cij)] = [ aij] + ([ bij] + [cij]) = A + (B + C)

(iii) Existence of additive identity  Let A = [aij] be an m × n matrix and
O be an m × n zero matrix, then A + O = O  + A = A. In other words, O is the
additive identity for matrix addition.
(iv) The existence of additive inverse  Let A = [ aij]m × n be any matrix, then we
have another matrix as – A = [–  aij]m × n such that A + (– A) = (– A) + A= O. So
– A is the additive inverse of A or negative of A.
3.4.4   Properties of scalar multiplication of a matrix
If A = [aij] and B = [ bij] be two matrices of the same order , say m × n, and k and l are
scalars, then
(i)k(A +B) = k A + 
kB, (ii) ( k + l)A = k A + l A
(ii) k (A + B) = k ([aij] + [ bij])
= k [aij + bij] = [ k (aij + bij)] = [( k aij) + ( k bij)]
= [k aij] + [ k bij] = k [aij] + k [bij] = kA + kB
(iii) (k + l) A = (k + l) [aij]
= [(k + l) aij] + [k aij] + [l aij] = k [aij] + l [aij] = k A + l A

or 2A + 3X – 2A = 5B – 2A
or 2A – 2A + 3X = 5B – 2A (Matrix addition is commutative)

3.4.5   Multiplication of matrices
Suppose Meera and Nadeem are two friends. Meera wants to buy 2 pens and 5 story
books, while Nadeem needs 8 pens and 10 story books. They both go to a shop to
enquire about the rates which are quoted as follows:
Pen – ` 5 each, story book – ` 50 each.
How much money does each need to spend? Clearly , Meera needs ` (5 × 2 + 50 × 5)
that is ` 260, while Nadeem needs (8 × 5 + 50 × 10) `, that is ` 540. In terms of matrix
representation, w e can write the above information as follows:

Suppose that they enquire about the rates from another shop, quoted as follows:
pen – ` 4 each,  story book – ` 40 each.
Now , the money required by Meera and Nadeem to make purchases will be
respectively ` (4 × 2 + 40 × 5) = ` 208 and ` (8 × 4 + 10 × 40) = `  432

The above is an example of multiplication of matrices. We observe that, for
multiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to
the number of rows in B. Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix,
we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum.
Formally , we define multiplication of matrices as follows:
The product  of two matrices A and B is defined  if the number of columns of A is
equal to the number of rows of B. Let A = [aij] be an m × n matrix and B = [ bjk] be an
n × p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m × p.
To get the ( i, k)th element cik of the matrix C, we take the ith row of A and kth column
of B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words ,
if A = [aij]m × n, B = [bjk]n × p, then the ith row of A is [ai1 ai2 ... ain] and the kth column of
B is 1

Remark   If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is
defined but BA  is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3)
rows. If A, B are, respectively m × n, k × l matrices, then both AB and BA  are defined
if and only if  n = k and l = m. In particular , if both A and B are square matrices of the
same order , then both AB and BA  are defined.
Non-commutativity of multiplication of matrices
Now , we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA  are both defined, it is not
necessary that AB = BA.
Example 13  If 2 31 2 3A and B 4 54 2 52 1 −    = =     −   , then find AB, BA. Show that
AB ≠ BA.
Solution Since A is a 2 × 3 matrix and B is 3 × 2 matrix. Hence AB and BA are both
defined and are matrices of order 2 × 2 and 3 × 3, respectively . Note that

Clearly AB ≠ BA
In the above example both AB and BA  are of dif ferent order and so AB ≠ BA. But
one may think that perhaps AB and BA  could be the same if they were of the same
order . But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA  are of
same order they may not be same.
Example 14  If 1 0A0 1 = −   and 0 1B1 0 =  , then 0 1AB1 0 = − .
and0 1BA1 0− =  . Clearly AB ≠ BA.
Thus matrix multiplication is not commutative.
Reprint 2025-26

ANote   This does not mean that AB ≠ BA for every pair of matrices A, B for
which AB and BA, are defined. For instance,
If  1 0 3 0A , B0 2 0 4   = =      , then AB = BA  = 3 0
0 8 
  
Observe that multiplication of diagonal matrices of same order will be commutative.
Zero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices
We know that, for real numbers a, b if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. This need
not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example.
Example 15 Find AB, if 0 1A0 2− =   and 3 5B0 0 =  .
Solution We have 0 1 3 5 0 0AB0 2 0 0 0 0−     = =          .
Thus, if the product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of
the matrices is a zero matrix.
3.4.6   Properties of multiplication of matrices
The multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without
proof.
1.The associative law  For any three matrices A, B and C. We have
(AB) C = A (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined.
2.The distributive law  For three matrices A, B and C.
(i)A (B+C) = AB + AC
(ii)(A+B) C = AC + BC, whenever both sides of equality are defined.
3.The existence of multiplicative identity  For every square matrix A, there
exist an identi ty matrix of same order such that IA = AI = A.
Now , we shall ver ify these properties by examples.
Example 16  If 1 1 1 1 31 2 3 4A 2 0 3 , B 0 2 and C2 0 2 13 1 2 1 4−    −      = = =      −     − −   , find

In this section, we shall learn about transpose of a matrix and special types of matrices
such as symmetric and skew symmetric matrices.
Definition 3
  If A = [aij] be an m × n matrix, then the matrix obtained by interchanging
the rows and columns of A is called the transpose of A. Transpose of the matrix A is
denoted by A′ or (AT). In other words, if A = [aij]m × n, then A′ = [aji]n × m. For example,

3.5.1  Properties of transpose of the matrices
We now state the following properties of transpose of matrices without proof. These
may be verified by taking suitable examples.
For any matrices A and B of suitable orders, we have
(i)(A′)′ = A, (ii) (kA)′ = kA′ (where k is any constant)
(iii) (A + B) ′ = A′ + B′ (iv) (A B)′ = B′ A′

3.6  Symmetric and Skew Symmetric Matrices
Definition 4  A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be symmetric  if A′ = A, that is,
[aij] = [aji] for all possible values of i and j.
For example 3 2 3
A 2 1.5 1

 = − − 
  −   is a symmetric matrix as A′ = A
Definition 5  A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be skew symmetric  matrix if
A′ = – A, that is aji = – aij for all possible values of i  and j. Now , if we put i = j, we
have  aii = – aii. Therefore 2 aii = 0 or aii = 0 for all i’s.
This means that all the diagonal elements of a skew symmetric matrix are zero.

B 0

 = − 
  − −  is a skew  symmetric matrix as B ′= –B
Now , we are going to prove some results of symmetric and skew-symmetric
matrices.
Theorem 1  For any square matrix A with real number entries, A + A ′ is a symmetric
matrix and A – A′ is a skew symmetric matrix.
Proof Let B = A + A′, then
B′ =(A + A′)′
=A′ + (A ′)′ (as (A  + B) ′ = A′ + B′)
=A′ + A (as (A ′)′ = A)
=A + A′ (as A + B = B + A)
=B
Therefore B = A + A′ is a symmetric matrix
Now let C = A – A ′
C′ =(A – A ′)′ = A ′ – (A ′)′     (Why?)
=A′ – A    (Why?)
=– (A – A
′) = – C
Therefore C = A – A ′ is a s kew symmetric matrix.
Theorem 2  Any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a
skew symmetric matrix.
Proof Let A be a square matrix, then we can write
1 1A (A A ) (A A )2 2′ ′ = + + −
From the Theorem 1, we know that (A  + A′) is a symmetric matrix and (A  – A′) is
a skew symmetric matrix. Since for any matrix A, (kA)′ = kA′, it follows that 1(A A )2′+
Reprint 2025-26

is symmetric matrix and 1(A A )2′−  is skew symmetric matrix. Thus, any square
matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix.

3.7  Invertible Matrices
Definition 6  If A is a square matrix of order m, and if there exists another square
matrix B of the same order m, such that AB = BA  = I, then B is called the inverse
matrix of A and it is denoted by A– 1. In that case A is said to be invertible.
For example, let A =2 3

Also BA =1 0I0 1 =  . Thus B is the inverse of A, in other
words B = A– 1 and A is inverse of B, i.e., A = B–1
Reprint 2025-26
MATRI CES         69
ANote
1.A rectangular matrix does not possess inverse matrix, since for products BA
and AB to be defined and to be equal, it is necessary that matrices A and B
should be square matrices of the same order .
2.If B is the inverse of A, then A is also the inverse of B.
Theorem 3  (Uniqueness of inverse) Inverse of a square matrix, if it exists, is unique.
Proof Let A = [aij] be a square matrix of order m. If possible, let B and C be two
inverses of A. We shall show that B = C.
Since B is the inverse of A
AB = BA = I ... (1)
Since C is also the inverse of A
AC = CA = I ... (2)
Thus B =BI = B (A C) = (BA) C = IC = C
Theor em 4  If A and B are invertible matrices of the same order , then (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1.
Proof  From the definition of inverse of a matrix, we have
(AB) (AB)–1 =1
or A–1 (AB) (AB)–1 =A–1I (Pre multiplying both sides by A–1)
or (A–1A) B (AB)–1 =A–1(Since A–1 I = A–1)
or IB (AB)–1 =A–1
or B (AB)–1 =A–1
or B–1 B (AB)–1 =B–1 A–1
or I (AB)–1 =B–1 
A–1
Hence (AB)–1 =B–1 A–1
1.  Matrices A and B will be inverse of each other only if

n nθ θ  = − θ θ , n ∈ N.
Solution We shall prove the result by using principle of mathematical induction.
We have P(n) : If cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = − θ θ , then cos sinAsin cosn n n
n nθ θ  = − θ θ , n ∈ N
P(1) : cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = − θ θ , so 1 cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = − θ θ 
Therefore, the result is true for n = 1.
Let the result be true for n = k. So

Therefore, the result is true for n = k  + 1. Thus by principle of mathematical induction,
we have cos sinAsin cosn n n
n nθ θ  = − θ θ , holds for all natural numbers.
Example 24  If A and B are symmetric matrices of the same order , then show that AB
is symmetric if and only if A and B commute, that is AB = BA.
Solution Since A and B are both symmetric matrices, therefore A′ = A and B ′ = B.

Let AB be symmetric, then (AB) ′ =AB
But (AB) ′ =B′A′= BA (Why?)
Therefore BA = AB
Conversely , if AB = BA, then we shall show that AB is symmetric.
Now (AB) ′ =B′A′
=B A (as A and B are symmetric)
=AB
Hence AB is symmetric.
