10.1  Introduction
In our day to day life, we come across many queries such
as – What is your height? How should a football player hit
the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe
that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,
a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which
is a real number . Such quantities are called scalars .
However , an answer to the second query is a quantity (called
force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and
direction (in which another player is positioned). Such
quantities are called vectors.  In mathematics, physics and
engineering, we frequently come across with both types of
quantities, namely , scalar quantities such as length, mass,
time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,
money , voltage, density , resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity ,
acceleration,  force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.
In this chapter , we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various
operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of
properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,
and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.
10.2  Some Basic Concepts
Let ‘l ’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given
two directions by means of arrowheads. A  line with one of these directions prescribed
is called a directed line (Fig 10. 1 (i), (ii)).Chapter 10

Now  observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude
is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed
line segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as
direction.
Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector .
Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as  or
simply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’.
The point A from where the vector  starts is called its initial point , and the
point B where it ends is called its terminal point . The distance between initial and
terminal po ints of a vector is called the magnitude  (or length) of the vector , denoted as
||, or ||, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector .
/handptrtsld1Note    Since the length is never negative, the notation || < 0 has no meaning.
Position Vector
From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system
(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P  in space, having coordinates ( x, y, z) with respect to
the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector  having O and P as its initial and terminal
points, r espectively , is called the position vector  of the point P  with respect
to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of  (or ) is given by
||=2 2 2x y z+ +
In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O
are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).Fig 10.1

Consider the position vector  of a point P( x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,
β, γ made by the vector  with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively ,
are called its direction angles . The cosine values of these angles, i.e., co sα, cosβ and
cosγ are called direction cosines  of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,
respectively .

From  Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we
have . Similarly , from the right angled triangles OBP  and
OCP, we may write cos  and cosy z
r rβ = γ = . Thus, the coordinates of the point P  may
also be expressed as ( lr, mr,nr).  The number s lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction
cosines are called as direction ratios  of vector  , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively .Fig 10.2

10.3  Types of Vectors
Zero Vector  A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector
(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction
as it has zero magnitude. Or , alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any
direction. The vectors  represent the zero vector ,
Unit Vector  A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector . The
unit vector in the direction of a given vector  is denoted by ˆa.
Coinitial Vectors  Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial
vectors.
Collinear  Vectors T wo or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to
the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.
Equal Vectors  Two vectors  are said to be equal, if they have the same
magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written
as .
Negative of a V ector  A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector
(say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector .
For example, vector  is negative of the vector , and written as  = – .
Remark  The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its
parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are
called free vectors . Throughout this chapter , we will be dealing with free vectors only .

of 40 km, 30° west of south.

10.4  Addition of Vectors
A vector  simply means the displacement from a point
A to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl
moves from A to B and then from B to C
(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from
point A to the point C, is given by the vector  and
expressed as
 = 
This is known as the triangle law of vector addition.
In general, if we have two vectors  and  (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are
positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other

and direction, so that it’ s initial point coincides with the terminal point of . Then, the
vector  + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or
resultant) of the vectors  and  i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have
 =
Now again, since , from the above equation, we have
This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order , it leads to zero
resultant as the initia l and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)).

The vector  is said to represent the differ ence of .
Now , consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a
direction perpendicular to the flow of the river . Then, it is acted upon by two velocity
vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the
velocity of the flow of river water . Under the simultaneous influence of these two
velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a dif ferent velocity . To have a precise
idea about the effective speed and direction
(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have
the following law of vector addition.
If we have  two vectors   represented
by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram
in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their
sum  is represented in magnitude and
direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram
through their common point. This is known as
the parallelogram law of vector addition.

addition are equivalent to each other .

10.5  Multiplication of a Vector  by a Scalar
Let  be a given vector and λ a scalar . Then the product of the vector  by the scalar
λ, denoted as λ, is called the multiplication of vector  by the scalar λ. Note that, λ
is also a vector , collinear to the vector . The vector λ  has the direction same (or
opposite) to that of vector  according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also,
the magnitude of vector λ is |λ| times the magnitude of the vector , i.e.,
|λ| =|λ|||
A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given
in Fig 10.12.

When λ  = –1, then λ= – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the
magnitude of  and direction opposite to that of the direction of . The vector –  is
called the negative (or additive inverse ) of vector  and we always have

as in Fig 10.14. Let P1 be the foot of the perpendicular from P  on the plane XOY .
We, thus, see that P1 P is parallel to z-axis. As ˆ ˆ ˆ,  and i j k  are the unit vectors along the
x, y and z-axes, respectively , and by the definition of the coordinates of P , we have

10.6  Pr oduct of Two Vectors
So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors. An other algebraic
operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may
recall that product of two numbers is a number , product of two matrices is again a
matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely ,
multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly ,
multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely , scalar (or dot)
product where the result is a scalar , and vector (or cross) product where the
result is a vector . Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have
found various applications in geometry , mechanics and engineering. In this section,
we will discuss these two types of products.

Solution Let  be a unit vector in XY -plane (Fig 10.28). Then, from the

Also, as θ varies from 0 to 2π , the point P (Fig 10.28) traces the circle x2 + y2 = 1
counterclockwise, and this covers all possible directions. So, (1) gives every unit vector

Historical Note
The word vector  has been derived from a Latin word vectus , which means
“to carry”. The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800
when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described
that how a complex number a + ib  could be given a geometric interpretation with
the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton
(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a
directed line segment in his book Lectur es on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’ s
method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:
ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ , , , a bi cj dk i j k+ + +  following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the
problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must
mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was
known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek
philosopher , and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be
known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding
them according to parallelogram law . The correct law for the composition of
forces, that forces add vectorially , had been discovered in the case of perpendicular
forces by S tevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of
geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der W eeghconst
(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the
development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept
of vectors to form.
In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and
mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer , created
what we now know as vector analysis , essentially by separating the real ( scalar )

part of quaternion from its imaginary ( vector ) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs
printed a treatise entitled Element of V ector Analysis . This book gave a systematic
and concise account of vectors. However , much of the credit for demonstrating
the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P .G. Tait (1831-1901)
who contributed significantly to this subject.
