10.1 Introduction
In the preceding Chapter 10, we have studied various forms
of the equations of a line. In this Chapter , we shall study
about some other curves, viz., circles, ellipses, parabolas
and hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are
given by Apollonius. These curves are in fact, known as
conic sections  or more commonly conics  because they
can be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double
napped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide
range of applications in fields such as planetary motion,
design of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in flashlights
and automobile headlights, etc.  Now , in the subsequent sections we will see how the
intersection of a plane with a double napped right circular cone
results in different types of curves.
10.2 Sections of a Cone
Let l be a fixed vertical line and m be another line intersecting it at
a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle α (Fig10.1).
Suppose we rotate the line m around the line l in such a way
that the angle α remains constant.  Then the surface generated is
a double-napped right circular hollow cone herein after referred as

cone and extending indefinitely far in both directions (Fig10.2).
The point V is called the vertex ; the line l is the axis of the  cone. The rotating line
m is called a generator  of the cone.  The vertex  separates the cone into two parts
called nappes .
If we take the intersection of a plane with a cone, the section so obtained is called
a conic section . Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a right
circular cone by a plane.
We obtain dif ferent kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the
intersecting plane with respect to the cone and by the angle made by it with the vertical
axis of the cone. Let β be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical
axis of the cone (Fig10.3).
The intersection of the plane with the cone can take place either at the vertex of
the cone or at any other part of the nappe either below or above the vertex.
10.2.1 Circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola  When the plane cuts the nappe (other
than the vertex) of the cone, we have the following situations:
(a) When 
β = 90o,  the section is a circle (Fig10.4).
(b) When α < β <  90o, the section is an  ellipse (Fig10.5).
(c) When β = α; the section is a parabola (Fig10.6).
(In each of the above three situations, the plane cuts entirely across one nappe of
the cone).
(d) When 0 ≤ β < α; the plane cuts through both the nappes and the curves of
intersection is a hyperbola  (Fig10.7).

10.2.2  Degenerated conic sections
When the plane cuts at the vertex of the cone, we have  the following  different cases:
(a) When α < β ≤ 90o, then the section is a point (Fig10.8).
(b) When β = α, the plane contains a generator of the cone and the section is a
straight line  (Fig10.9).
It is the degenerated case of a parabola.
(c) When 0 ≤ β < 
α, the section is a pair of intersecting straight lines (Fig10.10).
It is the degenerated case of a hyperbola .Fig 10. 6Fig 10. 7Fig 10. 5

Definition 1  A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed
point in the plane.
The fixed point is called the centr e of the cir cle and the distance from the centre
to a point on the circle is called the radius  of the circle (Fig 10.1 1).

The equation of the circle is simplest if the centre of the circle is at the origin.
However , we derive below the equation of the circle with a given centre and radius
(Fig 10.12).
Given C ( h, k) be the centre and r the radius of circle. Let P( x, y) be any point on
the circle (Fig10.12).  Then,  by the definition, | CP | = r . By the distance formula,
we have
2 2( ) ( )x – h y – k r + =
i.e. (x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r2
This is the required equation of the circle with centre at ( h,k) and radius r .
Example 1   Find an equation of the circle with centre at (0,0) and radius r.
Solution  Here
  h = k = 0. Therefore, the equation of the circle is x2 + y2 = r2.
Example 2  Find the equation of the circle with centre (–3, 2) and radius 4.
Solution  Here  h = –3, k = 2 and r = 4. Therefore, the equation of the required circle is
(x + 3)2 + (y –2)2 = 16
Example 3  Find the centre and the radius of the circle x2 + y2 + 8x + 10y – 8 = 0
Solution  The given equation is
(x2 + 8x)  + ( y2 + 10 y) = 8
Now , completing the squares within the parenthesis, we get
(x2 + 8x + 16)  +  ( y2 + 10y  + 25)  = 8 + 16 + 25
i.e. (x + 4)2 + (y + 5)2 = 49
i.e. {x – (– 4)}2 + {y  – (–5)}2 = 72
Therefore, the given circle has centre at (– 4, –5) and radius 7.Fig 10. 1 1 Fig 10. 12

Example 4  Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points (2, – 2), and
(3,4) and whose centre lies on the line x + y = 2.
Solution Let the equation of the circle be ( x – h)2 + (y – k)2 = r2.
Since the circle passes through (2, – 2) and (3,4), we have
(2 – h)2 + (–2 –  k)2 = r2... (1)
and (3 – 
h)2 + (4 – k)2 = r2... (2)
Also since the centre lies on the line x + y = 2, we have
h + k = 2 ... (3)
Solving the equations (1), (2) and (3), we get
h = 0.7,   k = 1.3  and r2 = 12.58
Hence, the equation of the required circle is
(x – 0.7)2 + (y  – 1.3)2 = 12.58.

Fig 10. 13
Fig 10.1410.4  Parabola
Definition 2  A parabola is the set of all points
in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed line
and a fixed point (not on the line) in the plane.
The fixed line is called the directrix  of
the parabola and the fixed point F is called the
focus  (Fig 10.13). (‘Para’  means ‘for ’ and
‘bola’ means ‘throwing’, i.e., the shape
described when you throw a ball in the air).
ANote    If the fixed point lies on the fixed
line, then the set of points in the plane, which
are equidistant from the fixed point and the
fixed line is the straight line through the fixed
point and perpendicular to the fixed line.  We
call this straight line as degenerate case  of
the parabola.
A line through the focus  and perpendicular
to the directrix   is called the axis of the
parabola. The point of intersection of parabola
with the axis is called the vertex of the parabola
(Fig10.14).
10.4.1 Standard equations of parabola
The equation of a parabola  is simplest if the
vertex is at the origin and the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis or y-axis. The four
possible such orientations of parabola are shown below in  Fig10.15 (a) to (d).

We will derive the equation for the parabola shown above in Fig 10.15 (a) with
focus  at (a, 0) a > 0; and directricx x = – a as below:
Let F be the focus  and l the directrix .  Let
FM be perpendicular to the directrix  and bisect
FM at the point O.  Produce MO to X.  By the
definition of  parabola, the mid-point O is on the
parabola and is called the vertex  of the parabola.
Take O as origin, OX the x-axis and OY
perpendicular to it as the y-axis.  Let the distance
from the directrix to the focus be 2 a. Then, the
coordinates of the focus  are ( a, 0),  and the
equation of the directrix  is x + a = 0 as in Fig10.16.
Let P( x, y) be any point on the parabola such that
PF = PB, ... (1)
where PB is perpendicular to l. The coordinates of B are (–  a, y). By the distance
formula, we have
PF = 2 2( )x – a y + and PB = 2( )x a+
Since PF = PB, we have
2 2 2( ) ( )x – a y x a + = +
i.e. (x – a)2 + y2 = (x + a)2
or x2 – 2ax + a2 + y2 = x2 + 2ax + a2
or y2 = 4ax ( a > 0).Fig 10.15 (a) to (d)
Fig 10.16
Reprint 2025-26
184    MA THEMA TICS
Hence, any point on the parabola satisfies
y2 = 4ax. ... (2)
Conversely , let P( x, y) satisfy the equation (2)
PF = 2 2( )x – a y + = 2( ) 4x – a ax +
= 2( )x a+ = PB ... (3)
and  so P( x,y) lies  on the parabola.
Thus, from (2) and (3) we have  proved that the equation to the parabola with
vertex at the origin, focus at ( a,0) and directrix x = – a is y2 = 4ax.
Discussion  In equation (2), since a > 0, x  can assume any positive value or zero but
no negative value and the curve extends indefinitely far into the first and the fourth
quadrants. The axis of the parabola is the positive x-axis.
Similarly , we can derive the equations of the parabola s in:
Fig 1 1.15 (b) as y2 = – 4 ax,
Fig 1 1.15 (c) as x2 = 4ay,
Fig 1 1.15 (d) as 
x2 = – 4ay ,
These four equations are known as standar d equations of parabola s.
ANote    The standard equations of  parabolas have focus on one of the coordinate
axis; vertex at the origin and thereby the directrix is parallel to the other coordinate
axis. However , the study of the equations of parabolas with focus at any point and
any line as directrix is beyond the scope here.
From the standard equations of the parabolas, Fig10.15, we have the following
observations:
1. Parabola is symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola.If the equation
has a y2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis and if the
equation has an x2 term, then the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis.
2. When the axis of symmetry is along the x-axis  the parabola opens to the
(a) right if the coefficient of x is positive,
(b) left if the coefficient of x  is negative.
3. When the axis of symmetry is along the y-axis the parabola opens
(c) upwards if the coefficient of y is positive.
(d) downwards if the coefficient of y is negative.

10.4.2 Latus rectum
Definition 3  Latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of
the parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola (Fig10.17).
To find the Length of the latus r
ectum of the parabola y2 = 4ax (Fig 10.18).
By the definition of the parabola, AF = AC.
But AC= FM = 2a
Hence AF= 2a.
And since the parabola is symmetric with respect to x-axis AF = FB and so
AB = Length of the latus rectum = 4 a.
Fig 10.17 Fig 10.18
Example 5  Find the c oordinates of the focus, axis,
the equation of the directrix  and latus rectum  of
the parabola y2 = 8x.
Solution  The given equation involves y2, so the
axis of symmetry is along the x-axis.
The coefficient of x is positive so the parabola opens
to the right. Comparing with the given equation
y2 = 4ax, we find that a = 2.
Thus, th e focus of the parabola  is (2, 0) and the equation  of the directrix of the parabola
is 
x = – 2 (Fig 10.19).
Length of the latus rectum is 4 a = 4 × 2 = 8.Fig 10.19

Example 6  Find the equation of the parabola with focus (2,0) and directrix x = – 2.
Solution  Since the focus (2,0) lies on the  x-axis, the 
x-axis itself is the axis of the
parabola. Hence the equation of the parabola is of the form either
y2 = 4ax or  y2 = – 4 ax. Since the directrix is x = – 2 and the focus is (2,0), the parabola
is to be of the form y2 = 4 ax with a = 2. Hence the required equation is
       y2 = 4(2) x = 8x
Example 7  Find the equation of the parabola with vertex   at (0, 0) and focus  at (0, 2).
Solution Since the vertex is at (0,0) and the focus is at (0,2) which lies on y-axis, the
y-axis is the axis of the parabola . Therefore, equation of the parabola is of the form
x2 = 4ay . thus, we have
x2 = 4(2)y , i.e., x2 = 8y.
Example 8  Find the equation of the parabola which is symmetric about the y-axis, and
passes through the point (2,–3).
Solution Since the parabola is symmetric about y-axis and has its vertex at the origin,
the equation is of the form x2 = 4ay or x2 = – 4 ay, where the sign depends on whether
the parabola opens upwards or downwards. But the parabola passes through (2,–3)
which lies in the fourth quadrant, it must open downwards. Thus  the  equation  is  of
the form x2 = – 4 ay.
Since the parabola passes through ( 2,–3), we have
22   = – 4a  (–3), i.e., a    =  1

10. 5 Ellipse
Definition 4  An ellipse  is the set of all points in
a plane, the sum of whose distances from two
fixed points in the plane is a constant.
The two fixed points are called the foci (plural
of ‘focus ’) of the ellipse (Fig10.20).
ANote   The constant which is the sum of
the distances of a point on the ellipse from the
two fixed points is always greater than the
distance between the two fixed points.
The mid point of the line segment joining the foci is called the centr e of the
ellipse.  The line segment through the foci of the ellipse is called the major  axis and the
line segment through the centre and perpendicular to the major axis is called the minor
axis.  
The end points of the major axis are called the vertices  of the ellipse(Fig 10.21).

axis, semi-minor axis and the distance of

Take a point P  at one end of the major axis.
Sum of the distances of the point P to the
foci is F1 P + F2P = F1O + OP + F2P
(Since,  F1P  = F1O + OP)
          = c + a + a – c = 2a
Take a point Q at one end of the minor axis.
Sum of the distances from the point Q  to the foci is
F1Q + F2Q= 2 2 2 2c b c b+ + +  =  2 22 c b+
Since both P and Q lies on the  ellipse.
By the definition of ellipse, we have
22 2c b+ =  2a, i.e., a =2 2c b+
or a2= b2 + c2
 , i.e., c = 2 2b a−.
10.5.2 Eccentricity
Definition 5
 The eccentricity of an ellipse is the ratio of the distances from the centre
of the ellipse to one of the foci and to one of the vertices of the ellipse (eccentricity is
denoted by e) i.e., cea=.
Then since the focus is at a distance of c from the centre, in terms of the eccentricity
the focus is at a distance of ae from the centre.
10.5.3 Standard equations of an ellipse  The  equation of  an ellipse is simplest if the
centre  of the ellipse is at the origin and the foci are on the x-axis or y-axis.  The two
such possible orientations are shown in Fig 10.24.

Similarly , the ellipse lies between the lines y = – b and y = b and touches these
lines.
Similarly , we can derive the equation of the ellipse in Fig 10.24 (b) as 2 2
2 21x y
b a+ = .
These two equations are known as standar d equations  of the ellipses.
ANote   The standard equations of  ellipses have centre at the origin and the
major and minor axis are coordinate axes. However , the study of the ellipses with
centre at any other point, and any line through the centre as major and the minor
axes passing through the centre and perpendicular to major axis are beyond the
scope here.
From the standard equations of the ellipses (Fig10.24), we have the following
observations:
1.Ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the coordinate axes since if
(x, y) is a point on the ellipse, then (–  x, y), (x, –y) and (–  x, –y) are also points on
the ellipse.
2.The foci  always lie on the major axis.  The major axis can be determined by
finding the intercepts on the axes of symmetry .  That is, major axis is along the x-axis
if the coefficient of x2 has the larger denominator and it is along the y-axis if the
coefficient of  y2 has the lar ger denominator .

10.6 Hyperbola
Definition 7  A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane, the dif ference of whose
distances from two fixed points in the plane is a constant.
Reprint 2025-26
196    MA THEMA TICS
The term “ differ ence” that is used in the definition means the distance to the
farther point  minus the distance to the closer point. The two fixed points are called the
foci of the hyperbola. The mid-point of the line segment joining the foci is called the
centr e of the hyperbola . The line through the foci is called the transverse axis  and
the line through the centre and perpendicular to the transverse axis is called the conjugate
axis. The points at which the hyperbola
intersects the transverse axis are called the
vertices of the hyperbola (Fig 10.27).
We denote the distance between the
two foci by 2 c, the distance between two
vertices (the length of the transverse axis)
by 2a and we define the quantity b as
b  = 2 2c – a
Also 2b  is the length of the conjugate axis
(Fig 10.28).
To find the constant P1F2 – P1F1 :
By taking the point P  at A and  B   in the Fig 10.28, we have
BF1  – BF2 =  AF2 – AF1 (by the definition of the hyperbola)
BA +AF1– BF2 = AB + BF2– AF1
i.e., AF1 =  BF2
So that,  BF1 – BF2 =  BA  + AF1– BF2 = BA  = 2aFig 10.27

10.6.1  Eccentricity
Definition 8  Just like an ellipse, the ratio e = c
a is called the eccentricity  of the
hyperbola .  Since c ≥ a, the eccentricity is never less than one.  In terms of the
eccentricity , the foci are at a distance of ae from the centre.
10.6.2  Standard equation of  Hyperbola  The equation of a hyperbola is simplest if
the centre of the hyperbola is at the origin and the foci are on the x-axis or y-axis.  The
two such possible orientations are shown in Fig10.29.
We will derive the equation for the hyperbola  shown in Fig 10.29(a) with foci on
the x-axis.
Let F1 and F2 be the foci and O be the mid-point of the line segment F1F2.  Let O
be the origin and the line through O
through F2 be the positive x-axis and
that through F1 as the negative
x-axis.  The line through O
perpendicular to the x-axis be the
y-axis.  Let the coordinates of F1 be
(– c,0) and F2 be (c,0) (Fig 10.30).
Let P( x, y) be any point on the
hyperbola such that the difference
of the distances from P to the farther
point minus the closer point be 2 a.
So given ,  PF1 – PF2 = 2aFig 10.29(a) (b)

2 2 2 2( ) ( ) 2x c y – x – c y a+ + + =
i.e.,2 2 2 2( ) 2 ( )x c y a x – c y+ + = + +
Squaring both side, we get
(x + c )2 + y2 = 4a2 + 4a  2 2( )x – c y +  + (x – c )2 + y2
and on simplifying, we get
acx – a = 2 2( )x – c y +
On squaring again and further simplifying, we get

Hence any point on the hyperbola satisfies  2 2

Similarly , PF2 = a – a

In hyperbola c > a; and since P is to the right of the line x = a, x > a, c
ax > a. Therefore,
a – c
a x  becomes negative.  Thus, PF2 =  c
ax  – a.
Reprint 2025-26
CONIC SECTIONS        199
Therefore PF1 –  PF2  = a  + c
ax  – cx
a  +  a = 2a
Also, note that if P is to the left of the line x = – a, then
PF1 c– a xa = +  ,  PF2 = a – cxa.
In that case P F2 – PF1 = 2a. So, any point that satisfies 2 2
2 21x y–
a b=, lies on the
hyperbola.
Thus,  we proved that the equation of hyperbola with origin (0,0) and transverse axis
along x-axis is  2 2
2 21x y–
a b=.
ANote   A hyperbola in which a = b is called an equilateral hyperbola .
Discussion  From the equation of the hyperbola we have obtained, it follows that,  we
have for every point ( x, y) on the hyperbola, 2 2
2 21x y
a b= +  ≥ 1.
i.e,  ax ≥ 1, i.e., x ≤ – a  or x ≥ a.   Therefore, no portion of the curve lies between the
lines x = + a
 and x = – a, (i.e. no real intercept on the conjugate axis).
Similarly , we can derive the equation of the hyperbola in Fig 1 1.31 (b) as 2 2
2 2y x
a b− = 1
These two equations are known as the standar d equations  of hyperbolas .
ANote   The standard equations of hyperbolas have transverse and conjugate
axes as the coordinate axes and the centre at the origin. However , there are
hyperbolas with any two perpendicular lines as transverse and conjugate axes, but
the study of such cases will be dealt in higher classes.
From the standard equations of hyperbolas (Fig10.27), we have the following
observations:
1. Hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both the axes, since if ( x, y) is a point on
the hyperbola, then (–  x, y), (x, – y) and (–  x, – y) are also points on the hyperbola.

2. The foci are always on the transverse axis.  It is the positive term whose
denominator gives the transverse axis.  For example,  2 2

10.6.3 Latus rectum
Definition 9  Latus rectum of hyperbola is a line segment perpendicular to the transverse
axis through any of the foci and whose end points lie on the hyperbola.
As in ellipse, it is easy to show that the length of the latus rectum in hyperbola is 22b

Example 16 Find the equation of the hyperbola where foci are (0, ±12) and the length
of the latus rectum is 36.
Solution  Since foci are (0, ± 12), it follows that c = 12.
Length of the latus rectum =  3622

Therefore   c2 = a2 + b2;  gives

i.e., a2 + 18a  – 144 = 0,
So  a = – 24, 6.

Example 17  The focus of a parabolic mirror as shown in Fig 10.31 is at a distance of
5 cm from its vertex. If the mirror is 45 cm deep, find
the distance AB (Fig 10.31).
Solution   Since the distance from the focus to the
vertex is 5 cm. We have, a = 5. If the origin is taken at
the vertex and the axis of the mirror lies along the

Historical Note
Geometry is one of the most ancient branches of mathematics. The Greek
geometers investigated the properties of many curves that have theoretical and
practical importance. Euclid wrote his treatise on geometry around 300 B.C. He
was the first who organised the geometric figures based on certain axioms
suggested by physical considerations. Geometry as initially studied by the ancient
Indians and Greeks, who made essentially no use of the process of algebra. The
synthetic approach to the subject of geometry as given by Euclid and in
Sulbasutras , etc., was continued for some 1300 years. In the 200 B.C., Apollonius
wrote a book called ‘ The Conic ’ which was all about conic sections with many
important discoveries that have remained unsurpassed for eighteen centuries.
Modern analytic geometry is called ‘ Cartesian ’ after the name of Rene
Descartes (1596-1650) whose relevant ‘La Geometrie’ was published in 1637.
But the fundamental principle and method of analytical geometry were already
discovered by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Unfortunately , Fermats treatise on
the subject, entitled Ad Locus Planos et So LIDOS Isagoge (Introduction to
Plane and Solid Loci) was published only posthumously in
1679. So, Descartes came to be regarded as the unique inventor of the analytical
geom etry.
Isaac Barrow avoided using cartesian method. Newton used method of
undetermined coefficients to find equations of curves. He used several types of
coordinates including polar and bipolar . Leibnitz used the terms ‘ abscissa ’,
‘ordinate’  and ‘coordinate’. L ’ Hospital (about 1700) wrote an important textbook
on analytical geometry .
Clairaut (1729) was the first to give the distance formula although in clumsy
form. He also gave the intercept form of the linear equation. Cramer (1750)
Reprint 2025-26
CONIC SECTIONS        207
made formal use of the two axes and gave the equation of a circle as
( y – a)2 + (b – x)2 = r
He gave the best exposition of the analytical geometry of his time. Monge
(1781) gave the modern ‘point-slope’ form of equation of a line as
y – y′ = a (x – x′)
and the condition of perpendicularity of two lines as aa′ + 1 = 0.
S.F. Lacroix (1765–1843) was a prolific textbook writer , but his contributions
to analytical geometry are found scattered. He gave the ‘two-point’ form of
equation of a line as
      β ββ = ( α)  α α–y – x ––′
′
and the length of the perpendicular from ( α, β) on y = ax + b as 2(β )
1– a – b
a+.
His formula for finding angle between two lines was tan θ  1a – a
aa′ = ′+ . It is, of
course, surprising that one has to wait for more than 150 years after the invention
of analytical geometry before finding such essential basic formula. In 1818, C.
Lame, a civil engineer , gave mE + 
m′E′ = 0 as the curve passing through the
points of intersection of two loci E = 0 and E ′ = 0.
Many important discoveries, both in Mathematics and Science, have been
linked to the conic sections. The Greeks particularly Archimedes (287–212 B.C.)
and Apollonius (200 B.C.) studied conic sections for their own beauty . These
curves are important tools for present day exploration of outer space and also for
research into behaviour of atomic particles.
