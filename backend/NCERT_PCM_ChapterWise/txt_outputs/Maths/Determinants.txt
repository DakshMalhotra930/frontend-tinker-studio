4.1  Introduction
In the previous chapter , we have studied about matrices
and algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system
of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of
matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like
a1 x + b1 y =c1
a2 x + b2 y =c2
can be represented as 1 1 1
2 2 2a b c x
a b c y     =           . Now , this
system of equations has a unique solution or not, is
determined by the number a1 b2 – a2 b1. (Recall that if
1 1
2 2a b
a b≠  or, a1 b2 – a2 b1 ≠ 0,  then the system of linear
equations has a unique solution). The number a1 b2 – a2 b1
which determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix 1 1
2 2Aa b
a b =  
and is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in
Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc.
In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries.
Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications
of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix,
consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear
equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix.
4.2  Determinant
To every square matrix A = [aij] of order n, we can associate a number (real or
complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where aij = (i, j)th element of A.Chapter 4

This may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a
unique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of
numbers (real or complex) and f : M →  K is defined by f(A) = k, where A
 ∈ M and
k ∈ K, then f(A) is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by |A| or det A or ∆ .
If A = a b

  , then determinant of A is written as |A| = a b
c d = det (A)
Remarks
(i)For matrix A, |A | is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A.
(ii) Only square matrices have determinants.

4.2.3  Determinant of a matrix of order 3 × 3
Determinant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of
second order determinants. This is known as expansion of a determinant along
a row (or a column). There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order

Step 1  Multiply first element a11 of R1 by (–1)(1 + 1) [(–1)sum of suf fixes in a11] and with the
second order determinant obtained by deleting the elements of first row (R1) and first
column (C1) of | A | as a1

Step 2 Multiply 2nd element a12 of R1 by (–1)1 + 2 [(–1)sum of suf fixes in a12] and the second

of | A | as a12 lies in R1 and C2,
i.e., (–1)1 + 2a12 21 23

Step 3  Multiply third element a13 of R1 by (–1)1 + 3 [(–1)sum of suf fixes in a13] and the second
order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R1) and third column (C3)
of | A | as a13 lies in R1 and C3,
i.e., (–1)1 + 3a13 21 22

terms obtained in steps 1, 2 and 3 above is given by

Clearly , values of |A| in (1), (2) and (3) are equal. It is left as an exercise to the
reader to verify that the values of |A| by expanding along R3, C2 and C3 are equal to the
value of |A| obtained in (1), (2) or (3).
Hence, expanding a determinant along any row or column gives same value.
Remarks
(i)For easier calculations, we shall expand the determinant along that row or column
which contains maximum number of zeros.
(ii) While expanding, instead of multiplying by (–1)i + j, we can multiply by +1 or –1
according as ( i + j) is even or odd.
(iii) Let A = 2 2

Observe that, |A| = 4(– 2) = 22|B| or |A| = 2n|B|, where n = 2 is the order of
square matrices A and B.
In general, if A = kB where A and B are square matrices of order n, then | A| = kn

4.3  Area of a Triangle
In earlier classes, we have studied that the area of a triangle whose vertices are
(x1, y1), (x2, y2) and ( x3, y3), is given by the expression 1
2[x1(y2–y3) + x2 (y3–y1) +
x3 (y1–y2)]. Now this expression can be written in the form of a determinant as
∆ =1 1

x y... (1)
Remarks
(i)Since area is a positive quantity , we always take the absolute value of the
determinant in (1).
(ii) If area is given, use both positive and negative values of the determinant for
calculation.
(iii) The area of the triangle formed by three collinear points is zero.

4.4  Minors and Cofactors
In this section, we will learn to write the expansion of a determinant in compact form
using minors and cofactors.
Definition 1 Minor of an element aij of a determinant is the determinant obtained by
deleting its ith row and jth column in which element aij lies. Minor of an element aij is
denoted by Mij.
Remark  Minor of an element of a determinant of order n(n ≥ 2) is a determinant of
order 
n – 1.
Example 8  Find the minor of element 6 in the determinant 1 2 3

Solution  Since 6 lies in the second row and third column, its minor M23 is given by
M23 =1 2
7 8 = 8 – 14 = – 6 (obtained by deleting R2 and C3 in ∆ ).
Definition 2  Cofactor of an element aij, denoted by Aij is defined by
Aij =(–1)i + j Mij, where Mij is minor of aij.
Example 9  Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant 1 –2
4 3
Solution  Minor of the element aij is Mij
Here a11 = 1. So M11 = Minor of a11= 3
M12 = Minor of the element a12 = 
4
M21 = Minor of the element a21 = –2
M22 = Minor of the element a22 = 1
Now , cofactor of aij is Aij. So
A11 = (–1)1 + 1  M11 = (–1)2 (3) = 3
A12 = (–1)1 + 2  M12 = (–1)3 (4) = – 4
A21 = (–1)2 + 1  M21 = (–1)3 (–2) = 2
A22 = (–1)2 + 2  M22 = (–1)4 (1) = 1

a a
   = a11 A11 + a12 A12 + a13 A13, where Aij is cofactor of aij
    = sum of product of elements of R1 with their corresponding cofactors
Similarly , ∆ can be calculated by other five ways of expansion that is along R2, R3,
C1, C2 and C3.
Hence ∆ = sum of the product of elements of any row (or column) with their
corresponding cofactors.
ANote   If elements of a row (or column) are multiplied with cofactors of any
other row (or column), then their sum is zero. For example,
∆ = 
a11 A21 + a12 A22 + a13 A23
= a11 (–1)1+1 12 13

4.5 Adjoint and Inverse of a Matrix
In the previous chapter , we have studied inverse of a matrix. In this section, we shall
discuss the condition for existence of inverse of a matrix.
To find inverse of a matrix A, i.e., A–1 we shall first define adjoint of a matrix.
4.5.1   Adjoint of a matrix
Definition 3 The adjoint of a square matrix A = [aij]n × n is defined as the transpose of
the matrix [Aij]n × n, where Aij is the cofactor of the element aij. Adjoint of the matrix A
is denoted by adj A.

are also nonsingular matrices of the same order .

In general, if A is a square matrix of order n, then |adj(A)| = 
|A|n – 1.
Theor em 4 A  square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix.
Proof Let A be invertible matrix of order n and I be the identity matrix of order n.
Then, there exists a square matrix B of order n such that AB = BA  = I
Now AB = I.  So AB = I    or   A B = 1    (since I 1, AB A B ) = =
This gives A≠ 0. Hence A is nonsingular .
Conversely , let A be nonsingular . Then A ≠ 0
Now A (adj A) = ( adj A) A = AI (Theorem 1)
or A 1 1A A A I| A | | A |adj adj   = =      
or AB = BA = I, where B = 1A| A |adj

4.6  Applications of Determinants and Matrices
In this section, we shall discuss application of determinants and matrices for solving the
system of linear equations in two or three variables and for checking the consistency of
the system of linear equations.
Reprint 2025-26
 94 MATHEMA TICS
Consistent system A  system of equations is said to be consistent  if its solution (one
or more) exists.
Inconsistent system A  system of equations is said to be inconsistent  if its solution
does not exist.
ANote  In this chapter , we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations
having unique solutions only .
4.6.1   Solution of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix
Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using
inverse of the coefficient matrix.
Consider the system of equations
a1 x + b1 y + c1 z = d1
a2 x + b2 y + c2 z =d2
a3 x + b3 y + c3 z =d3
Let A =1 1 1 1

Then, the system of equations can be written as, AX = B, i.e.,

Case I  If A is a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists. Now
AX = B
or A–1 (AX) = A–1 B (premultiplying by A–1)
or (A–1A) X = A–1 B (by associative property)
or I X = A–1 B
or X =A–1 B
This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as
inverse of a matrix is unique. This method of solving system of equations is known as
Matrix Method.
Case II  If A is a singular matrix, then |A| = 0.
In this case, we calculate ( adj A) B.
If (adj A) B ≠ O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the
system of equations is called inconsistent.
Reprint 2025-26
DETERMINANTS      95
If (adj A) B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according
as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution.
Example 16  Solve the system of equations
2x + 5y = 1
3x + 2y = 7
Solution  The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where
A =2 5 1,X and B3 2 7x

Now , A = –1 1 ≠ 0, Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution.

A = 3 (2 – 3) + 2(4 + 4) + 3 (– 6 – 4) = – 17 ≠ 0
Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists. Now
A11 = –1, A12 = – 8, A13 = –10
A21 = –5, A22 = – 6, A23 = 1
A31 = –1, A32 = 9, A33 = 7

second number to it, we get 1 1. By adding first and third numbers, we get double of the

Solution  Let first, second and third numbers be denoted by x, y and z, respectively .
Then, according to given conditions, we have

Historical Note
The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of
several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the
discovery of simple method of elimination. The arrangement of rods was precisely
that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the
idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant
Mikami, China, pp 30, 93.
Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth
century in his work ‘ Kai Fukudai no Ho ’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of
determinants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a
quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous
linear equations. T. Hayashi, “ The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese
Mathematics ,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V
.
Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.
He may be called the formal founder . Laplace (1772), gave general method of
expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange
treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose
other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his
theory of numbers.
The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who
stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-
rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.
Also on the same day , Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He
used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication
theorem more satisfactory than Binet’ s.
The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after
this the word determinant received its final acceptance.
