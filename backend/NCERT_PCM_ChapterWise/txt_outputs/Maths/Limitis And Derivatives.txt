12.1  Introduction
This chapter is an introduction to Calculus. Calculus is that
branch of mathematics which mainly deals with the study
of change in the value of a function as the points in the
domain change. First, we give an intuitive idea of derivative
(without actually defining it). Then we give a naive definition
of limit and study some algebra of limits. Then we come
back to a definition of derivative and study some algebra
of derivatives. We also obtain derivatives of certain
standard functions.
12.2  Intuitive Idea of Derivatives
Physical experiments have confirmed that the body dropped
from a tall cliff covers a distance of 4.9 t2 metres in t seconds,
i.e., distance s in metres covered by the body as a function of time t in seconds is given
by s = 4.9 t2.
The adjoining Table 13.1 gives the distance travelled in metres at various intervals
of time in seconds of a body dropped from a tall cliff.
The objective is to find the veloctiy of the body at time t = 2 seconds from this
data. One way to approach this problem is to find the average velocity for various
intervals of time ending at t = 2 seconds and hope that these throw some light on the
velocity at t = 2 seconds.
Average velocity between t = t1 and t = t2 equals distance travelled between
 t = t1 and t = t2  seconds divided by  ( t2 – t1). Hence the average velocity in the first
two seconds12 Chapter

Likewise we compute the average velocitiy
between  t = t1 and t = 2 for various t1. The following
Table 13.2 gives the average velocity ( v), t = t1
seconds and t = 2 seconds.

From Table 12.2, we observe that the average velocity is gradually increasing.
As we make the time intervals ending at t = 2 smaller , we see that we get a better idea
of the velocity at t = 2. Hoping that nothing really dramatic happens between 1.99
seconds and 2 seconds, we conclude that the average velocity at t = 2 seconds is just
above 19.551 m/s.
This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the following set of computation.
Compute the average velocities for various time intervals starting at  t = 2 seconds. As

The following Table 12.3 gives the average velocity v in metres per second

Here again we note that if we take smaller time intervals starting at t = 2, we get
better idea of the velocity at t = 2.
In the first set of computations, what we have done is to find average velocities
in increasing time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens
just before t = 2. In the second set of computations, we have found the average velocities
decreasing in time intervals ending at t = 2 and then hope that nothing dramatic happens
just after t = 2. Purely on the physical grounds, both these sequences of average
velocities must approach a common limit. We can safely conclude that the velocity of
the body at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. Technically , we say that the
instantaneous velocity at t = 2 is between 19.551 m/s and 19.649 m/s. As is
well-known, velocity is the rate of change of displacement . Hence what we have
accomplished is the following. From the given data of distance covered at various time
instants we have estimated the rate of
change of the distance at a given instant
of time. We say that the derivative  of
the distance function s = 4.9t2 at t = 2
is between 19.551 and 19.649.
An alternate way of viewing this
limiting process is shown in Fig 12.1.
This is a plot of distance s of the body
from the top of the cliff versus the time
t elapsed. In the limit as the sequence
of time intervals h1, h2, ..., approaches
zero, the sequence of average velocities
approaches the same limit as does the
sequence of ratios Fig 12.1

where C1B1 = s1 – s0 is the distance travelled by the body in the time interval h1 = AC1,
etc. From the Fig 12.1 it is safe to conclude that this latter sequence approaches the
slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. In other words, the instantaneous velocity
v(t) of a body at time t = 2 is equal to the slope of the tangent of the curve s = 4.9 t2 at
t = 2.
12.3 Limits
The above discussion clearly points towards the fact that we need to understand limit-
ing process in greater clarity . We study a few illustrative examples to gain some famil-
iarity with the concept of limits.
Consider the function f(x) = x2. Observe that as x takes values very close to 0,
the value of f(x) also moves towards 0 (See Fig 2.10 Chapter 2). We say
()
0lim 0
xf x
→=
(to be read as limit of f (x) as x tends to zero equals zero).  The limit of f (x) as x tends
to zero is to be thought of as the value f (x) should assume at x = 0.
In general as x → a, f (x) → l, then l is called limit of the function f  (x) which is
symbolically written as () lim
x af x l
→=.
Consider the following function g(x) = |x|, x ≠0. Observe that g (0) is not defined.
Computing the value of g(x) for values of x very
near to 0, we see that the value of g(x) moves
towards 0. So, 0lim
x→ g(x) = 0. This is intuitively
clear from the graph of y = |x| for x ≠0.
(See Fig 2.13, Chapter 2).
Consider the following function.
( )24, 22xh x xx−= ≠−.
Compute the value of h(x) for values  of
x very near to 2 (but not at 2). Convince yourself
that all these values are near to 4. This is
somewhat strengthened by considering the graph
of the function y = h(x) given here (Fig 12.2). Fig 12.2

  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            221
In all these illustrations the value which the function should assume at a given
point x = a did not really depend on how  is x tending to a. Note that there are essentially
two ways x could approach a number a  either from left or from right, i.e., all the
values of x near a could be less than a or could be greater than a. This naturally leads
to two limits – the right hand limit  and the left hand limit . Right hand limit of a
function f(x) is that value of f(x) which is dictated by the values of f(x) when x tends
to a from the right. Similarly , the left hand limit . To illustrate this, consid er the function
( )1, 0
2, 0xf xx≤ => 
Graph of this function is shown in the Fig 12.3. It is
clear that the value of f at 0 dictated by values of f(x) with
x ≤ 0 equals 1, i.e., the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is
0lim ( ) 1
xf x
→=.
Similarly , the value of f at 0 dictated by values of
f (x) with x > 0 equals 2, i.e., the right hand limit of f (x)
at 0 is
0lim ( ) 2
xf x
+→=.
In this case the right and left hand limits are different, and hence we say that the
limit of f (x) as x tends to zero does not exist (even though the function is defined at 0).
Summary
  We say lim
x a→– f(x) is the expected value of  f at x = a given the values of f near
x to the left of a. This value is called the left hand limit  of f at a.
We say lim ( )
x af x
+→ is the expected value of f at x = a given the values of
f near x to the right of a. This value is called the right hand limit of f(x) at a.
If the right and left hand limits coincide, we call that common value as the limit
of f(x) at x = a and denote it by lim
x a→ f(x).
Illustration 1  Consider the function f(x) = x + 10. We want to find the limit of this
function at x = 5. Let us compute the value of the function f(x) for x very near to 5.
Some   of the points near and to the left of 5 are 4.9, 4.95, 4.99, 4.995. . ., etc. Values
of the function at these points are tabulated below . Similarly , the real number 5.001,Fig 12.3
Reprint 2025-26
222 MATHEMA TICS
5.01, 5.1 are also points near and to the right of 5. Values of the function at these points
are also given in the Table 12.4.
Table 12.4
From the Table 12.4, we deduce that value of f(x) at 
x = 5 should be greater than
14.995 and less than 15.001 assuming nothing dramatic happens between x = 4.995
and 5.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 5 as dictated by
the numbers to the left of 5 is 15, i.e.,
()–5lim 15
xf x
→= .
Similarly , when x approaches 5 from the right,  f(x) should be taking value 15 , i.e.,
()
5lim 15
xf x
+→= .
Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are
both equal to 15. Thus,
() () ()
5 5 5lim lim lim 15
x x xf x f x f x
− +→ → →= = = .
This conclusion about the limit being equal to 15 is somewhat strengthened by
seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.16, Chapter 2. In this figure, we
note that as x approaches 5 from either right or left, the graph of the function
f(x) = x +10 approaches the point (5, 15).
We observe that the value of the function at x = 5 also happens to be equal to 15.
Illustration 2  Consider the function f(x) = x3. Let us try to find the limit of this
function at x = 1. Proceeding as in the previous case, we tabulate the value of f(x) at
x near 1. This is given in the Table 12.5.

x = 0.999 and 1.001. It is reasonable to assume that the value of the f(x) at x = 1 as
dictated by the numbers to the left of 1 is 1, i.e.,
()

Similarly , when x approaches 1 from the right, f(x) should  be taking value 1, i.e.,
()
1lim 1

Hence, it is likely that the left hand limit of f(x) and the right hand limit of f(x) are
both equal to 1. Thus,

This conclusion about the limit being equal to 1 is somewhat strengthened by
seeing the graph of this function which is given in Fig 2.1 1, Chapter 2. In this figure, we
note that as x approaches 1 from either right or left, the graph of the function
f(x) = x3 approaches the point (1, 1).
We observe, again, that the value of the function at x = 1 also happens to be
equal to 1.
Illustration 3  Consider the function f(x) =
 3x. Let us try to find the limit of this
function at x = 2. The following Table 12.6 is now self-explanatory .

from either left or right, the value of f(x) seem to
approach 6. We record this as

fact.
Here again we note that the value of the function
at x = 2 coincides with the limit at x = 2.

Graph of f(x) = 3 is anyway the line parallel to x-axis passing through (0, 3) and

fact, it is easily observed that () lim 3

x close to 0 (in this table  n denotes any positive integer).

note that  in general, at a given point the value of the function and its limit may be
different (even when bot h are defined).
12.3.1  Algebra of limit s In the above illustrations, we have observed that the limiting
process respects addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as long as the limits
and functions under consideration are well defined. This is not a coincidence. In fact,
below we formalise these as a theorem without proof.
Theorem 1  Let f  and g be two functions such that both lim
x a→ f (x) and  lim
x a→ g(x) exist.
Then
  (i) Limit of sum of two functions is sum of the limits of the functions, i.e.,
lim
x a→[f(x) + g (x)] =  lim
x a→ f(x) +  lim
x a→ g(x).
 (ii) Limit of difference of two functions is difference of the limits of the functions, i.e.,
lim
x a→[f(x) – g(x)] =  lim
x a→ f(x) –  lim
x a→ g(x).
(iii) Limit of product of two functions is product of the limits of the functions, i.e.,
lim
x a→ [f(x) . g(x)] =  lim
x a→ f(x).  lim
x a→ g(x).
(iv) Limit of quotient of two functions is quotient of the limits of the functions (whenever
the denom inator is non zero), i.e.,

12.4 Limits of Trigonometric Functions
The following facts (stated as theorems) about functions in general come in handy in
calculating limits of some trigonometric functions.
Theorem 3  Let f and gbe two real valued functions with the same domain such that
f (x) ≤ g( x) for all x in the domain of definition, For some a, if both lim
x a→ f(x) and
lim
x a→ g(x) exist, then lim
x a→ f(x) ≤ lim
x a→ g(x). This is illustrated in Fig 12.8.
Theorem 4  (Sandwich Theorem)  Let f, g and h be real functions such that
f (x) ≤ g( x) ≤ h(x) for all x in the common domain of definition. For some real number
a, if lim
x a→  f(x) = l = lim
x a→ h(x), then lim
x a→ g(x) = l. This is illustrated in Fig 12.9.
Given below is a beautiful geometric proof of the following important
inequality relating trigonometric functions.
sincos 1xxx< < for π02x< < (*)Fig 12.8

Reprint 2025-26
  LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES            235
Proof  We know that sin (– x) =  – sin x and cos( – x) = cos x. Hence, it is suf ficient
to prove the inequality for π02x< < .
In the Fig 12.10, O is the centre of the unit circle such that
the angle AOC  is x radians and 0 < x < π
2. Line segments B A and
CD are perpendiculars to OA . Further , join AC. Then
Area of OAC∆ < Area of sector OAC < Area of ∆OAB.
i.e.,2 1 1OA.CD .π.(OA) OA.AB2 2 π 2x< < .
i.e., CD < x . OA  < AB.
From ∆OCD,
sin x = CD
OA(since OC = OA) and hence CD  = OA  sin x. Also  tan x =AB
OAand
hence AB = OA . tan x. Thus
OA sin x  < OA . x < OA . tan x.
Since length OA  is positive, we have
sin x < x < tan 
x.
Since 0 < x <π
2, sinx is positive and thus by dividing throughout by sin x, we have
1<1
sin cosx
x x< . Taking reciprocals throughout, we have
sincos 1xxx< <
which complete the proof.
Theorem 5  The following are two important limits.
(i) 
0sinlim 1

x →=. (ii) 
01 coslim 0

Proof  (i) The  inequality in (*) says that the function sinx
xis sandwiched  between the
function cos x and the constant function which takes value 1.Fig 12.10
Reprint 2025-26
236 MATHEMA TICS
Further , since 0lim
x→ cos x = 1, we see that the proof of (i) of the theorem is
complete by sandwich theorem.
To prove (ii), we recall the trigonometric identity 1 – cos x = 2 sin2

A general rule that needs to be kept in mind while evaluating limits is the following.
Say, given that the limit  ()
( )lim
x af x
g x→ exists and we want to evaluate this. First we check
the value of f (a)  and g(a). If both are 0, then we see if we can get the factor which
is causing the terms to vanish, i.e., see if we can write f(x) = f1 (x) f2(x) so that
f1 (a) = 0 and 
f2 (a) ≠ 0. Similarly , we write g(x) = g1 (x) g2(x), where g1(a) = 0 and
g2(a) ≠ 0. Cancel out the common factors from f(x) and g (x) (if possible) and write
()

g x q x=, where q(x) ≠ 0.

12.5  Derivatives
We have seen in the Section 13.2, that by knowing the position of a body at various
time intervals it is possible to find the rate at which the position of the body is changing.
It is of very general interest to know a certain parameter at various instants of time and
try to finding the rate at which it is changing. There are several real life situations
where such a process needs to be carried out. For instance, people maintaining a
reservoir need to know when will a reservoir overflow knowing the depth of the water
at several instances of time, Rocket Scientists need to compute the precise velocity
with which the satellite needs to be shot out from the rocket knowing the height of the
rocket at various times. Financial institutions need to predict the changes in the value of
a particular stock knowing its present value. In these, and many such cases it is desirable
to know how a particular parameter is changing with respect to some other parameter .
The heart of the matter is derivative of a function at a given point in its domain
of definition.

ric interpretation of derivative of a
function at a point. Let y = f(x) be
a function and let P = ( a, f(a)) and
Q = ( a + h, f(a + h) be two points
close to each other on the graph
of this function. The Fig 12.1 1 is

hf a h f af ah →+ −′=
From the triangle PQR, it is clear that the ratio whose limit we are taking is
precisely equal to tan(QPR) which is the slope of the chord PQ. In the limiting process,
as h tends to 0, the point Q tends to P and we have
()()
0 Q PQRlim limPR hf a h f a

This is equivalent to the fact that the chord PQ tends to the tangent at P of the
curve y = f(x). Thus the limit turns out to be equal to the slope of the tangent. Hence
()tanψ f a′= .
For a given function f  we can find the derivative at every point. If the derivative
exists at every point, it defines a new function called the derivative of f . Formally , we
define derivative of a function as follows.
Definition 2  Suppose f  is a r eal valued function, the function defined by

involve limits in a rather direct fashion, we expect the rules for derivatives to follow
closely that of limits. We collect these in the following theorem.

rule.

(iv) Derivative of quotient of two functions is given by the following quotient
rule (whenever the denominator is non–zero).

The proofs of these follow essentially from the analogous theorem for limits. We
will not prove these here. As in the case of limits this theorem tells us how to compute
derivatives of special types of functions. The last two statements in the theorem may
be restated in the following fashion which aids i n recalling them easily:
Let () u f x=  and v= g (x). Then
( )uv′ =u v uv′ ′+
This is referred to a Leibnitz rule for differentiating product of functions or the

function 1. This is because ()f x′=()()
0lim
hf x h f x
h →+ − = 
0lim
hx h x
h →+ −
=0lim1 1
h→=.
We use this and the above theorem to compute the derivative of
f(x) = 10x = x + .... + x (ten terms). By ( i) of the above theorem
     ( )df x
dx =d
dx ( ) ...x x+ +  (ten terms)
= . . .d dx xdx dx+ +   (ten terms)
=1 ... 1+ +  (ten terms) = 10.
We note that this limit may be evaluated using product rule too. Write
f(x) = 10 x = uv, where u is the constant function taking value 10 everywhere and
v(x) = x. Here, f(x) = 10 x = uv we know that the derivative of u equals 0. Also
derivative of v(x) = x equals 1. Thus by the product rule we have
()f x′ =( ) ( )10 0. 10.1 10 x uv u v uv x′ ′ ′ ′ = = + = + =
On similar lines the derivative of f(x) = x2 may be evaluated. We have
f(x) = x2 = x .x and hence
df
dx =( ) ( ) ( ) . . .d d dx x x x x xdx dx dx= +
=1. .1 2x x x+ = .
More generally , we have the following theorem.
Theorem 6  Derivative of f(x) = xn is nxn – 1 for any positive integer n.
Proof By definition of the derivative function, we have
       ( )()()

Alternatively , we may also prove this by induction on n and the product rule as
follows. The result is true for n = 1, which has been proved earlier . We have

Remark  The above theorem is true for all powers of x, i.e., n can be any real number
(but we will not prove it here).
12.5.2  Derivative of polynomials and trigonometric functions   We start with the
following theorem which tells us the derivative of a polynomial function.
Theorem 7  Let f(x) 
= 1

−+ + + +  be a polynomial function, where
ai s are all real numbers and an ≠ 0. Then, the derivative function is given by

− = + − + +  2 12a x a+.
Proof of this theorem is just putting together part (i) of Theorem 5 and Theorem 6.
Example 13

above function is 99 54600 55 1x x− + .

Summary
®The expected value of the function as dictated by the points to the left of a
point defines the left hand limit of the function at that point. Similarly the right
hand limit.
®Limit of a function at a point is the common value of the left and right hand
limits, if they coin cide.
®For a function f and a real number a, lim
x a→ f(x) and f (a) may not be same (In
fact, one may be defined and not the other one).

Historical Note
In the history of mathematics two names are prominent to share the credit for
inventing calculus, Issac Newton (1642 – 1727) and G .W. Leibnitz (1646 – 1717).
Both of them independently invented calculus around the seventeenth century .
After the advent of calculus many mathematicians contributed for further
development of calculus. The rigorous concept is mainly attributed to the great
Reprint 2025-26
256 MATHEMA TICS
mathematicians, A.L. Cauchy , J.L.Lagrange and Karl Weierstrass. Cauchy gave
the foundation of calculus as we have now generally accepted in our textbooks.
Cauchy used D’  Alembert’ s limit concept to define the derivative of a function.
Starting with definition of a limit, Cauchy gave examples such as the limit of
sinα
α for α= 0. He wrote ( ) ( ),y f x i f x
x i∆ + −=∆ and called the limit for
0,i→ the “function derive’e, y′ for f ′ (x)”.
Before 1900, it was thought that calculus is quite difficult to teach. So calculus
became beyond the reach of youngsters. But just in 1900, John Perry and others
in England started propagating the view that essential ideas and methods of calculus
were simple and could be taught even in schools. F .L. Grif fin, pioneered the
teaching of calculus to first year students. This was regarded as one of the most
daring act in those days.
Today not only the mathematics but many other subjects such as Physics,
Chemistry , Economics and Biological Sciences are enjoying the fruits of calculus.
