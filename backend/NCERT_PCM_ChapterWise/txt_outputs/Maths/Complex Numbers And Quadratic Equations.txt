4.1  Introduction
In earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in one
and two variables and quadratic equations in one variable.
We have seen that the equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no real
solution as x2 + 1 = 0 gives x2 = – 1 and square of every
real number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the
real number system to a larger system so that we can
find the solution of the equation x2 = – 1. In fact, the main
objective is to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
D = b2 –  4ac < 0, which is not possible in the system of
real numbers.
4.2  Complex Numbers
Let us denote 1− by the symbol i. Then, we have 21 i=− . This means that i is a
solution of the equation x2 + 1 = 0.
A number of the form a + ib, where a and b are real numbers, is defined to be a
complex number . For example, 2 + i3,  (– 1) + 3i,  1411i− +   are complex numbers.
For the complex number z = a + ib, a is called the real par
t, denoted by Re z and
b is called the imaginary part  denoted by Im z of the complex number z . For example,
if z = 2 + i5, then Re z = 2 and Im z  = 5.
Two complex numbers z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id are equal if  a = c and b = d.4

Example 1  If 4x + i(3x – y) = 3 + i (– 6), where x and y are real numbers, then find
the values of x and y.
Solution
 We have
4x + i (3x – y) = 3 + i  (–6) ... (1)
Equating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get
4x = 3, 3x  – y = – 6,
which, on solving simultaneously , give  3
4x= and 33
4y= .
4.3   Algebra of Complex Numbers
In this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers.
4.3.1    Addition of two complex numbers  Let z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id be any two
complex numbers. Then, the sum  z1 + z2 is defined as follows:
z1 + z2 = (a + c) + i (b + d), which is again a complex number .
For example, (2 + i3) + (– 6 + i5) = (2 – 6) + 
i (3 + 5) = – 4 + i 8
The addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties:
(i)The closur e law   The sum of two complex numbers is a complex
number , i.e., z1 + z2 is a complex number for all complex numbers
z1 and z2.
(ii) The commutative law   For any two complex numbers z1 and z2,
z1 + z2 = z2 + z1
(iii) The associative law   For any three complex numbers z1, z2, z3,
(z1 + z2) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3).
(iv) The existence of additive identity  There exists the complex number
0 + i 0 (denoted as 0), called the additive identity  or the zero complex
number , such that, for every complex number z, z + 0 = z.
(v) The existence of additive inverse   To every complex number
z = a + ib, we have the complex number –  a + i(– b) (denoted as –  z),
called the additive inverse or negative of z.  We observe that z + (–z) = 0
(the additive identity).
4.3.2   Difference of two complex numbers  Given any two complex numbers z1 and
z2, the difference z1 – z2 is defined as follows:
z1 – z2 = z1 + (– z2).
For example, (6 + 3 i) – (2 – i) = (6 + 3
i) + (– 2 + i  ) = 4 + 4i
and (2 –  i) – (6 + 3 i) = (2 – i ) + ( – 6 – 3 i) = – 4 – 4 i

4.3.3  Multiplication of two complex numbers  Let z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id be any
two complex numbers. Then, the product z1 z2 is defined as follows:
z1 z2 = (ac 
–  bd) + i(ad + bc)
For example, (3 + i5) (2 + i6) = (3 × 2 – 5 × 6) + i(3 × 6 + 5 × 2) = – 24 + i28
The multiplication of complex numbers possesses the following properties, which
we state without proofs.
(i)The closur e law The product of two complex numbers is a complex number ,
the product z1 z2 is a complex number for all complex numbers z1 and z2.
(ii) The commutative law For any two complex numbers z1 and z2,
z1 z2 = z2 z1.
(iii) The associative law For any three complex numbers z1, z2, z3,
(z1 z2) z3 = z1 (z2 z3).
(iv) The existence of multiplicative identity There exists the complex number
1 + i 0 (denoted as 1),  called the multiplicative identity  such that z.1 = z ,
for every complex number z.
(v) The existence of multiplicative inverse For every non-zero complex
number z  = a + ib or a + bi(a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0), we have the complex number
2 2 2 2a –bi
a b a b+
+ + (denoted by 1
z or z–1 ), called the multiplicative inverse
of z such that
11 z.z= (the multiplicative identity).
(vi) The distributive law For any three complex numbers z1, z2, z3,
(a)  z1 (z2 + z3) = 
z1 z2 + z1 z3
(b)  ( z1 + z2) z3 = z1 z3 + z2 z3

In general, for any integer k, i4k = 1, i4k + 1 = i, i4k + 2 = –1, i4k + 3 = – i
4.3.6  The square roots of a negative real number
Note that   i2 = –1 and  ( – i)2 = i2 = – 1
Therefore,  the square roots of – 1 are i, – i. However , by the symbol 1−, we would
mean i only .
Now , we can see that i and – i both are the solutions of the equation x2 + 1 = 0 or
x2 = –1.
Similarly ()()2 2
3 3i=  i2 = 3 (– 1) = – 3
()2
3i−  = ()2
3−  i2 = – 3
Therefore,  the square roots of –3 are 3i and 3i− .
Again, the symbol 3− is meant to represent 3i only , i.e., 3− = 3i.
Generally , if a is a positive real number , a− = 1 a− = a i,
We already know that a b×  = ab for all positive real number a and b. This
result  also holds true when either a > 0, b < 0  or a < 0,  
b > 0. What if a < 0, b  < 0?
Let us examine.
Note that

( )( )21 1 1 1 i= − − = − −  (by assuming a b×  = ab for all real numbers)
= 1 = 1,  which is a contradiction to the fact that =−21i .
Therefore, a b ab× ≠  if both a and b are negative real numbers.
Further , if any of a and b is zero, then, clearly , a b ab× = = 0.
4.3.7 Identities  
We prove the following identity
( )2 2 2
1 2 1 2 1 2 2 z z z z z z+ = + + , for all complex numbers z1 and z2.
Proof  
We have, (z1 + z2)2 = (z1 + z2) (z1 + z2),
=  (z1 + z2) z1 + (z1 + z2) z2(Distributive law)

1 2 1 1 2 2z z z z z z+ + + (Distributive law)

1 1 2 1 2 2z z z z z z+ + + (Commutative law of multiplication)
    = 2 2
1 1 2 22z z z z+ +
Similarly , we can prove the following identities:

to be true for all complex numbers.

4.4  The Modulus and the Conjugate of a Complex Number
Let z = a + ib be a complex number . Then, the modulus of z, denoted by |  z |, is defined
to be the  non-negative real number 2 2a b+ , i.e., |  z | = 2 2a b+  and the conjugate
of z, denoted as z, is the complex number a –  ib, i.e.,  z = a –  ib.
For example,2 23 3 1 10i+ = + = , 2 22 5 2 ( 5) 29i− = + − = ,
and 3 3i i+ = − ,  2 5 2 5 i i− = + , 3 5i− −  = 3i – 5
Observe that the multiplicative inverse of the non-zero complex number z is
given by
z–1 = 1

4.5  Argand Plane and Polar  Repr esentation
We already know that corresponding to
each ordered pair of real numbers
(x, y), we get a unique point in the XY -
plane and vice-versa with reference to a
set of mutually perpendicular lines known
as the x-axis and the y-axis. The complex
number x + iy which  corresponds to the
ordered pair ( x, y) can be represented
geometrically as the unique point P( x, 
y)
in the XY -plane and vice-versa.
Some complex numbers such as
2 + 4 i, – 2 + 3i , 0 + 1 i, 2 + 0i , – 5 –2 i and
1 – 2i  which correspond to the ordered
pairs (2, 4), ( – 2, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), ( –5, –2), and (1, – 2), respectively , have been
represented geometrically by the points A, B, C, D, E, and F , respectively in
the Fig 4.1.
The plane having a complex number assigned to each of its point is called the
complex plane  or the Argand plane .
Reprint 2025-26

Obviously , in the Argand plan e, the modulus of the complex number
x + iy = 2 2x y+  is the distance between the point P( x, y) and the origin O (0, 0)
(Fig 4.2). The points on the x-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the form
a + i 0 and the points on the y-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the form
Fig 4.2
Fig 4.30 + i b. The x-axis and y-axis in the Argand plane are called, respectively , the real axis
and the imaginary axis .
The representation of a  complex number z = x + iy and its conjugate
z = x – iy in the Argand plane are, respectively , the points P  (x, y) and Q (
x, – y ).
Geometrically , the point ( x, – y) is the mirror image of the point ( x, y) on the  real
axis (Fig 4.3).

Historical Note
The fact that square root of a negative number does not exist in the real number
system was recognised by the Greeks. But the credit goes to the Indian
mathematician Mahavira
 (850) who first stated this dif ficulty clearly . “He
mentions in his work ‘ Ganitasara Sangraha ’ as in the nature of things a negative
(quantity) is not a square (quantity)’,  it has, therefore, no square root”.
Bhaskara , another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work Bijaganita ,
written in 1 150. “There is no square root of a negative quantity , for it is not a
square.” Cardan (1545) considered the problem of solving
x + y = 10, xy  = 40.
Reprint 2025-26
88       MA THEMA TICS
—vvvvv—He obtained x = 5 + 15− and y = 5 – 15− as the solution of it, which
was discarded by him by saying that these numbers are ‘useless’.  Albert
Girar d (about 1625) accepted square root of negative numbers and said that
this will enable us to get as many roots as the degree of the polynomial equation.
Euler  was the first to introduce the symbol i for 1− and W.R. Hamilton
(about 1830) regarded the complex number a + ib as an ordered pair of real
numbers ( a, b) thus giving it a purely mathematical definition and avoiding use
of the so called ‘ imaginary numbers ’.
