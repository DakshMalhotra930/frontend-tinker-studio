9.1  Introduction
We are familiar with two-dimensional coor dinate geometr y
from earlier classes. Mainly , it is a combination of algebra
and geometry . A systematic study of geometry by the use
of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French
philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book
‘La Géométry , published in 1637. This book introduced the
notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical
methods into the study of geometry . The resulting
combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as
analytical geometr y. In the earlier classes, we initiated
the study of coordinate geometry , where we   studied about
coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a
plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the
basics of coordinate geometry .
Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To
recapitulate, the location of the points (6, – 4) and
(3, 0) in the XY -plane is shown in Fig 9.1.
We may note that the point (6, – 4) is at 6 units
distance from the y-axis measured along the positive
x-axis and at 4 units distance from the x
-axis
measured along the negative y-axis. Similarly , the
point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the y-axis
measured along  the positive x-axis and has zero
distance from the x-axis.
We also studied there following important
formulae:9 Chapter

In the this Chapter , we shall continue the study of coordinate geometry to study
properties of the simplest geometric figure – straight line.  Despite its simplicity , the
line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous
interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically , for
which slope  is most essential.
9.2  Slope of a Line
A line in a coordinate plane forms two angles with the x-axis, which are supplementary .
Reprint 2025-26
STRAIGHT LINES       153
The angle (say) θ made by the line l with positive
direction of x-axis and measured anti clockwise
is called the inclination of the line . Obviously
0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (Fig 9.2).
We observe that lines parallel to x-axis, or
coinciding with x-axis, have inclination of 0°. The
inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or
coinciding with y-axis) is 90°.
Definition 1  If θ is the inclination of a line
l, then tan θ is called the slope  or gradient  of
the line l.
The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not
defined.
The slope of a line is denoted by m.
Thus, 
m = tan θ, θ ≠ 90°
It may be observed that the slope of x-axis is zero and slope of y-axis is not defined.
9.2.1  Slope of a line when coordinates of any two points on the line are given
We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it.
Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a
line in terms of the coordinates of two points
on the line.
Let P( x1, y1) and Q( x2, y2) be two
points on non-vertical line l whose inclination
is θ. Obviously , x1 ≠ x2, otherwise the line
will become perpendicular to x-axis and its
slope will not be defined. The inclination of
the line l may be acute or obtuse. Let us
take these two cases.
Draw perpendicular QR to x-axis and
PM perpendicular to RQ as shown in
Figs. 9.3 (i) and (ii).
Case 1  When angle  θ is acute:
In Fig 9.3 (i), ∠ MPQ =  θ. ... (1)
Therefore, slope of line l = m = tan θ.

Case II   When angle θ is obtuse:
In Fig 9.3 (ii), we have
 ∠MPQ = 180° –  θ.
Therefore,  θ = 180° – ∠MPQ.
Now , slope of the line l

Consequently , we see that in both the cases the slope m of the line through the points
(x1, y1) and ( x2, y2) is given by  2 1

9.2.2  Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their
slopes In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical lines l1 and l2 have slopes  m1
and m2, respectively . Let their inclinations be α and
β, respectively .
If the line 
l1 is parallel to l2 (Fig 9.4), then their
inclinations are equal, i.e.,
α = β, and hence, tan α = tan β
Therefore m1 = m2, i.e., their slopes are equal.
Conversely , if the slope of two lines l1 and l2
is same, i.e.,
m1 = m2.
Then tan α = tan β.
By the property of tangent function (between 0° and 180°), α = β.
Therefore, the lines are parallel.Fig 9. 3 (ii)
Fig 9. 4
Reprint 2025-26
STRAIGHT LINES       155
Hence, two non ver tical lines l1 and l2 are parallel if and only if their slopes
are equal.
If the lines  l1 and l2 are perpendicular (Fig 9.5), then β = α + 90° .
Therefore, tan β = tan ( α + 90°)
=– cot α = 1
tanα−
i.e., m2 = 
11
m−or m1  m2  = – 1
Conversely , if m1  m2  =  – 1, i.e., tan α tan 
β = – 1.
Then tan α = – cot β = tan ( β + 90°) or tan ( β – 90°)
Therefore, α  and β differ by 90°.
Thus, lines  l1 and l2 are perpendicular to each other .
Hence,  two non-ver tical lines ar e perpendicular to each other if and only if
their slopes ar e negative r ecipr ocals of each other ,
i.e., m2=

m−  or,  m1 m2 = – 1.
Let us consider the following example.

(d)Here inclination of the line α = 60°. Therefore, slope of the line is
m = tan 60° = 3.
9.2.3 Angle between two lines  When we think about more than one line in a plane,
then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the
angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.
Let L1 and L2 be two non-vertical lines with slopes m1 and m2, respectively . If α1
and α2 are the inclinations of lines L1 and L2, respectively . Then
α tan and α tan2 2 1 1 = = m m .
We know that when two lines intersect each other , they make two pairs of
vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is 180° . Let θ and
φ be the adjacent angles between the lines L1 and L2 (Fig 9.6). Then
θ = α2 – α1 and α1, α2  ≠ 90°.
Therefore  tan θ = tan ( α2 – α1) 2 1 2 1

9.3   Various Forms  of the Equation of a Line
We know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship
between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:
How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that
for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.
Suppose P  (x, y
) is an arbitrary point in the XY -plane and L  is the given line. For the
equation of L, we wish to construct a statement  or condition  for the point P that is
true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic
equation involving the variables x and y . Now , we will discuss the equation of a line
under different conditions.
9.3.1  Horizontal and vertical lines  If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-
axis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)] .
Therefore, equation of the line L is either y =  a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend
upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly ,
the equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or
x =  – b  [Fig 9.8(b)].

(– 2, 3).
Solution  Position of the lines is shown in the
Fig 9.9. The y-coordinate of every point on the

of the line parallel to x-axis and passing through
(– 2, 3) is y = 3. Similarly , equation of the line
parallel  to y-axis and passing through (– 2, 3)
is x = – 2.
9.3.2  Point-slope form   Suppose that
P0 (x0, y0) is a fixed point on a non-vertical
line L, whose slope is m. Let P
 (x, y) be an
arbitrary point on L (Fig 9.10).
Then, by the definition, the slope of L is given
by
( )xxm yyxxyym0 0
00  , i.e. , − = −−−=
                       ...(1)
Since the point P0 (x0 , y0) along with
all points ( x, y) on L satisfies (1) and  no other
point in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1)
is indeed the equation for the given line L.Fig  9.8

Thus, the point ( x, y) lies on the line with slope m through the fixed point ( x0, y0),
if and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation
y – y0 = m  (x – x0)
Example 5
 Find the equation of the line through (– 2, 3) with slope – 4.
Solution Here m = – 4 and given point ( x0 , y0) is ( – 2, 3).
By slope-intercept form formula
(1) above, equation of the given
line is
y – 3 = – 4 ( x + 2) or
4x + y + 5 = 0, which is the
required equation.
9.3.3 Two-point form  Let the
line L passes through two given
points P1 (x1, y1) and P2 (x2, y2).
Let P ( x, y) be a general point
on L (Fig 9.1 1).
The three points P1, P2 and P are

intercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines.Fig 9.1 1

(Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the  y-

coordinates of the point where the line meet
the y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m
and passes through a fixed point (0, c).
Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation
of L is

Thus, the point ( x, y) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and
