Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’ s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system
and causes a gap between the school, home and community . The syllabi and textbooks
developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries
between dif ferent subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information
passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing
the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’ s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in
small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCER T) appreciates
the hard work done by the Textbook Development Committee responsible for this

ivbook. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and
Mathematics, Professor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book
Professor P .K. Jain for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and or ganisations which
have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and
Professor G .P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an or ganisation
committed to the systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its
products, NCER T welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to
undertake further revision and refinement.

vRationalisation of Content in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content
load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In
this background, the NCER T has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks
across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCER T across
classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class
•Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject
•Difficulty level
•Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-
learning
•Content, which is irrelevant in the present context
This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.
